== Chapter IV. Journeys And Correspondence, From 1833 to 1841.

In the spring of 1834, I felt a concern to attend Philadelphia Yearly Meeting,
and having obtained a minute of the approbation of our Monthly Meeting, I proceeded,
and attended the same accordingly, to good satisfaction.

Providence, 23rd of 8th mo.
1833.

[.salutation]
Dear Friend, John Wilbur,

A few days after thou returned home,
I took our friend Stephen Gould over to William Almy`'s,
who had a letter from Thomas Shillitoe to Stephen which
William charged Stephen to be careful about showing;
the latter on taking it handed it to me.
I found it to contain as full a statement of matters in England,
and in some respects more so than thou had mentioned;
its date is since their last Yearly Meeting,
at which their revisal of the discipline was completed.
He says, in effect,
that a party there charge Barclay with contradicting himself--that
he has done great injustice to the Scriptures,
by placing them as the secondary instead of the primary means of salvation.

Perhaps this may be a mistaken understanding of the case, as it seems too bad to hold,
by any professing with us.
He says the enemy has laid his snare there in a different way from Hicksism.
By some the Son is set up above the Father;
and mere faith in the atonement and blood of Christ is held
to be sufficient for salvation (very little inward work).
These doctrines are securing for them the right hand of fellowship from other professors,
as it is to be feared is the case with some in America;
and those who adhere to the ancient faith and doctrine are
stigmatized with the appellation of Hicksites.

Thomas considers it a great favor to them and us,
that Divine Goodness had commissioned and sent over some good, sound,
faithful valiants from this side the water,
who have helped to hold up their hanging-down hands,
against the inroads of the wicked one;
thus opening a more full and desirable channel for the communication of their
sentiments on this painful subject than any epistolary correspondence by them,
these having seen and heard and felt for themselves the deceivableness
of the spirit that is at work among Friends there.
It is mentioned by some to account for Thomas thus writing,
that the Hicksites claimed him on his arrival at New York in 1828.

This, by J. J. Gurney, who, it is to be feared, is too much of the new school.
Immediately on our sitting down in William Almy`'s house, he inquired after thee,
and complained that thou had promised to call on him when thou was at Providence.
I immediately cleared thee by frankly telling him
he must lay thy not seeing him at his house to me,
for thou had proposed to me to go with thee;
but I gave him my opinion that it would be best for you not to meet at present;
and I told William I thought it would be better for him in particular to have a respite,
as it had taken too deep hold of his mind.

I had no other objection to accompanying thee to see him save an impression that
it would be best for him and for thee that it be left for another time;
as the matter of difference^
footnote:[John Wilbur`'s Letters to George Crosfield.]
had been gone into pretty fully at the Meeting for Sufferings,
and was thought by Daniel Howland to be well left.
I thought best to mention this to thee, hoping he will cool off about it before we meet.
If thou hast S. F. Hussey`'s answer to Rand,
please look over the conclusion which was written by W. A. I think thou
will find that to contain some doctrine that he hardly holds up of late.
I intend setting him to look it over for the refreshing of his memory.
I consider it one of the best of his declarations and that it will bear inspection.

With love to thyself, wife and family, I conclude.

Dear Friend,

I duly received thine and note its contents.
Yesterday our friend S. Rhoads read to me part of a letter from his son,
saying that +++_______+++ of +++_______+++ in England,
writes that Elisha Bates was then giving trouble to the select Yearly Meeting.
He says that H. Backhouse was engaged in visiting families in Kendal,
the hotbed of Beaconism,
that Isaac Braithwaite and sons had proposed to the Quarterly Meeting`'s
committee to send up a request that the Yearly Meeting will decide whether
the Scriptures or the Spirit is the primary rule of faith and practice,
that it was objected to and held the parties till between eleven and twelve o`'clock
at night before a minute was agreed on to be signed by the clerk.

This is in confirmation of a letter received by Stephen Gould.
I apprehend the London Yearly Meeting if they consider the
question will not be at a loss to unite with Barclay,
against J. Wilkinson, E. Bates, and the Beacon party,
unless that party be larger than I have an idea of.
We shall expect soon to hear the issue.
Joseph John Gurney has written severely in opposition
to the anonymous writer against the Beacon,
and there is an advertisement of the printer that printed the last answer to J. Wilkinson,
that there was in the press an answer by the same anonymous writer,
against Joseph John`'s remarks on him.

I think Joseph John may be whipped by him, and I should not be sorry to see it.
William Jenkins and a few others who were opposed to doing anything against the Beacon,
as followers of Elisha Bates, I think are now beat,
and have nothing to say in favor of Elisha or the Beacon Friends;
and I am in hopes we shall be clear of that trouble here.

I remain with love to thyself and family; thy friend,

+++[+++The foregoing letters are selected from a considerable number from Moses Brown,
written in a familiar and affectionate style,
but mostly relating to local Society affairs,
until the development of the unsound views promulgated by Elisha Bates and the Beaconites;
when he spoke out plainly in condemnation of this heresy,
and evinced much concern for the preservation of the Society
on its original ground of principle and practice.

[.offset]
It is evident from these letters,
that he regarded J. J. Gurney as being strongly imbued with Beaconite sentiments,
and in private conversation with John Wilbur,
they always agreed in their views on this subject.
Notwithstanding the opposition evinced by his son-in-law, William Almy, to the latter,
on account of the letters written by him to Geo.
Crosfield, while in England, (see appendix,) Moses Brown continued friendly,
and expressed his satisfaction with those letters,
and with the avowed design of the author in writing them.

[.offset]
He met with much opposition from W. A., W. J.,
and others on account of the stand he made against the introduction
of innovating doctrines into the Society.
On the occasion of a social visit of the latter, accompanied by S. A. Chace,
they introduced the subject of the paramount authority of the Holy Spirit,
and the subordination thereto of the Scriptures, as always held by Friends,
and committed themselves against this view,
and in favor of the paramount authority of the Scriptures;
maintaining that all religious impressions and whatsoever is vital in religion,
is borrowed from the Bible.

[.offset]
Moses Brown firmly withstood them herein;
maintaining the views of R. Barclay on this question, and of the Society since his day;
and when they quoted the passage "`All Scripture is given by inspiration of God,
and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction,
for instruction in righteousness,`" etc., he took it up and turned it against them;
showing that it sustained his view, saying,
in substance that as the Scriptures emanated from the divine fountain of all good,
so in the language of Barclay, as the stream cannot rise higher than the fountain,
the Scriptures cannot justly be elevated above their divine Author.

[.offset]
That they are profitable for doctrine, reproof, instruction, etc.,
he as fully believed as they did;
and the Society always set them above all other writings,
and acknowledged that they were the only fit outward judge of controversy among Christians.
He alluded to his own experience in this regard,
particularly in the matter of his slaves;
saying that after the decease of his first wife,
who made a remarkably satisfactory and peaceful close, when returning from the grave,
ruminating upon the Lord`'s mercies and favors to him, the query arose in his mind,
what shall I render unto thee for thy lovingkindness and abundant mercy?
when his slaves were all passed in review before him;
adding "`I saw them with my spiritual eye as plainly as I see you now,
and it was given me as clearly to understand that the sacrifice that was
called for at my hands was to give them their liberty;`" and he concluded
by saying "`these impressions were not from the Bible.`"
But as W. Jenkins continued to press his views,
he turned to him and said "`William thou art not right,
and thou never will be while thou continues to hold such sentiments as these.`"

[.offset]
Moses Brown was remarkable for his uprightness and
consistency during a long life of nearly 98 years.
He was entrusted with a large share of this world`'s goods,
which he was concerned to hold in due subordination to religious obligations;
hence his philanthropy was proverbial, though not ostentatious;
observing in an uncommon degree this injunction of our Lord:
"`When thou doest thine alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth.`"
His house was always open for the entertainment of Friends;
and his hospitality in this respect was experienced by many.

[.offset]
Being a man of good natural parts, and of large and varied information,
he was interesting and agreeable in conversation beyond most,
on which account his company and advice were much sought by men of all classes,
not only within his own community, but beyond its limits; and his simplicity of manner,
unassuming deportment,
unbending integrity and consistent adherence to his religious principles,
won for him the respect and veneration of all who sought his acquaintance.
For many years he occupied the station of an elder in the Society of Friends;
and during the latter part of his life he occasionally spoke in our religious
meetings to the comfort and satisfaction of the right-minded.]

In the winter of 1836-7,
I visited Friends (with a certificate) in several
of the eastern counties of the State of New York,
my wife bearing me company as far as our son-in-law`'s, William R. Hazard`'s,
in Dutchess County.

[.offset]
+++[+++No account of this visit has been found among J. W.`'s papers,
but the following incident connected with it, is given from recollection by his children,
(in whose presence he several times related it,)
as nearly in his own words as could be recollected.]

Ethan Foster accompanied us on this visit as far as Hartford;
where I had a prospect of holding a public meeting;, should way open for it.
We went to see the celebrated Joel Hawes,
(popularly known as Dr. Hawes,) for the purpose of getting
his consent for a meeting in his lecture room;
having been informed that it would be a convenient place,
and that his permission to hold the meeting there would
go far towards giving us credence with the people,
and induce many to attend who otherwise might not.
On meeting him, he received us civilly; but when informed of the object of our visit,
he did not favor it--said he was careful as to whom he admitted there
to preach--thought that Quakerism and Puritanism would not be likely to
work well together--that he regarded the Quakers as a superficial people:
to which I replied that that might arise from a want
of acquaintance with them and their principles;
but he still hesitated about it, and said that New England was the theatre of Puritanism,
Connecticut its stronghold, and Hartford its centre,
and that Quakerism was its antagonist.

He then asked me what I was going to preach about.
I told him I did not know; nor did I know certainly that I should preach at all:
to which he replied,
"`don`'t know what you are going to preach about!
then I think you will make poor work of it;
I have tried a few times in that way, and I did; and I think you will;
but if you do not preach at all, I shall.`"
After some further conversation, he said, "`if I allow you to hold the meeting,
you must promise not to preach against my favorite doctrine, '`once in grace,
always in grace:`'`" to which I replied, that I could not accept it on those terms;
pausing a little, he said, "`Well, I think I shall risk you;
but if you attack my favorite doctrine, I shall oppose you.`"

At the meeting, he took his seat by my side, and pretty soon said,
"`I think you had better commence your service,
as I presume the people are generally in.`"
There being no response to this, he soon after made a similar remark,
and then sat quietly, until I arose, and while I was speaking.
Soon after I sat down,
he arose and recommended strongly to their attention what had been said,
and repeated the words of Peter:
"`Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons,
but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness
is accepted with him;`"--then proceeded to say in substance,
these men came to my house, and asked permission to hold a meeting here;
and after some conversation with them, believing them to be vital Christians,
I consented to admit them; and he concluded by saying,
"`you now see how vital Christians can worship together,
although they may honestly differ in some things.`"

In the spring of 1837, I attended the Yearly Meeting in the city of New York.
In the course of this visit,
I met with some very trying cases of an unsanctified ministry.
And, in the city, I fell in with J. J. Gurney, from England,
with a certificate liberating him for religious service in this country.
I had before met with him in England; and, as then, so now,
I believe him to be unsound in the doctrines of Friends; and, therefore,
improperly in this country as a minister, and likely to bring much trouble upon us.
I felt it a duty, to let some Friends know that I had not unity with him,
nor with his mission here as a minister.
And when he came to New England, the following month,
I found it to rest as an obligation upon me to let him know personally,
that not only myself, but many others,
were dissatisfied with many of his religious sentiments.

Stoke Newington, 5th, of 6th mo.. 1833.

[.salutation]
Dear And Valued Friend,

My address to thee must be short,
for I have been much engaged from day to day during this Yearly Meeting, having,
in the intervals of the various sittings, many Friends at my lodging in town,
and at night a house full here, besides visits from elders, etc.
Oh, how often have I thought of thee! and how painfully have
thy forebodings of mischief among us been realized!
Alas, the enemy of all good has prevailed to no very limited extent;
and the insidious spirit that showed itself last year, appears now to be mighty indeed,
speaking great swelling word, and, for the most part, has had the preeminence,
both in meetings for worship and discipline.

This being permitted, has, however, opened the eyes of many,
who were before unwilling to think that things among us were such as called for alarm.
I, for one, am rather relieved,
in the open manifestation of error in doctrine that has taken place.
I wished for farther opportunity to lay down my burden in the meeting at large,
and requested it, without effect; but am satisfied in doing what I could.
There have been awful moments among us,
when the state of things was clearly laid open in Truth`'s own authority.

I understand, that a visit from the elders is impending for me;
may I be enabled to keep in the quiet, holy habitation.
The same individuals who were crying peace, peace, last year, have done so, this year,
with increased boldness; yea, a lying spirit is gone forth, and many are believing it;
yet some are distinctly evincing the true spirit of prophecy,
which declares against all that would devise an easier way to glory,
than by the true ladder.
We have with us here our loved niece, Ann Moore; I think her already a brave soldier.
I leave a scrap of this sheet for her to cover, and will now take leave.

Am glad dear Ann Coning has written largely to thee.
Charles Osborn lodged here last night; he leaves this land now soon.
Farewell.--My husband and children love John Wilbur.
Hoping we may be near in spirit still, I remain thy afflicted and affectionate friend,

Stockport, 11th mo., 21st, 1833.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend John Wilbur,

Thy truly acceptable letter of the 15th ult.
was welcome to my hand yesterday.
I have thought much of thee of late,
and wished to give thee a tangible proof of my continued sisterly sympathy with thee,
and desire for thy preservation from all the power of the enemy
in this time of close sifting and proving of faith and patience;
for we are not ignorant of Satan`'s devices, and know full well how ready he is,
when he cannot cast down below hope,
to try to stir up to undue activity in vindicating one`'s own cause or proceedings.

Do not mistake me,
my dear friend--I write not this from any apprehension
that thou hast fallen into this snare,
but rather as an encouragement to thee to be guarded on this hand,
whilst thou art endeavoring to stand firmly and uprightly
to what thou believest to be right.
It was a noble testimony which the enemies of Daniel bore to his integrity and faithfulness,
even when they sought his life:
"`We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel except we
find it against him concerning the law of his God.`"

The times in which we live are perilous,
and all those who would be in deed and in truth the followers of a crucified Lord,
have abundant need to look well to their standing,
to mind his divine injunction--"`What I say unto you I say unto all--watch,
watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation.`"
Some of us are aware that our proceedings are narrowly watched--may the Lord be my keeper,
and then it matters little what man may say or do unto me.

Do present my husband`'s and my love to our much
esteemed and worthy ancient friend Moses Brown.
Dear old man! he has stood some storms in his day, and, if he lives awhile longer,
he will see things that he has not yet seen;
for surely the clouds are gathering and the storm will burst with violence somewhere,
I verily believe.
May the Lord Jehovah be our strength and our song; then will he be our salvation,
and our safe hiding-place in time of trouble.
I am glad that in dear M. B. thou hast an open and firm friend;
but what are others about, to skulk behind the binnacle,
when they should come forth and show themselves?
If they have Truth on their side, they have nothing to fear;
and those who are not engaged on the side of Truth,
had better not meddle with church affairs.

Elisha Bates landed at Liverpool (if I mistake not) the latter part of 8th mo.;
he has been at and passed through Manchester repeatedly,
but we have neither seen him nor received a line or message from him,--true,
we have not written to him,
and it is but too plain that he does not want to
have any intercourse with or help from us.
Anna Braithwaite and he were at the Quarterly Meeting at York in the 9th mo.
together, also at that at Darlington, soon after; from there to Kendal Quarterly Meeting,
and then it was planned for Isaac Braithwaite to go with E. B. as companion,
without his even going again to Liverpool,
but this was overruled by a letter from I. Hadwen,
at whose house Elisha lodges when at Liverpool, contrary to A. B.`'s intention,
for she had written to meet him on his arrival to request he would go to K. Benson`'s,
but happily the letter did not reach him until he was settled at I. H.`'s.

I know not that it matters much where he is,
for I. and A. B. take care to stick so closely to him,
that there is not much room for others; they were at Liverpool with him,
and Isaac took high ground as to his concern to accompany
E+++.+++ B. A letter from a friend says:
"`The whole tenor of A. B.`'s conduct ever after they met E. B. at York
shows the stress she lays upon having it appear that he is one with them.
By much that I have heard of late,
it is clear they wish to have it believed that the views they have differ little,
if at all, from sound Friends.`"

Here is the subtlety of that spirit which causes divisions in the church.
E+++.+++ B. and I. B. have both been plainly told that it was contrary
to the mind and judgment of Friends for I. B. to accompany E. B.,
and that it was likely to close up the way in many minds from receiving him or his ministry,
as they otherwise would,
on account of Isaac having come out so openly in the conference a year since,
with views differing from those held by the Society
from the beginning--but all this matters not;
they are gone together to the west of England, where there are many valuable Friends,
who are not inclined to join in with the new views.

I wish they may be firm and honest to their feelings, then good will come out of it;
but alas! there are so few who keep a straightforward course, with the eye single,
in times of difficulty, that it makes it harder for those who do.
Nevertheless, I do not believe they will accomplish much, if anything,
at our Yearly Meeting, respecting the conference; and if, by trying their strength,
they may be convinced of their weakness, it will be well.

Whoever lives to see it,
I believe all those who are really enlisted under
the banner of a crucified Lord and leader,
and who follow him faithfully, without fear or favor of man, will have to suffer deeply,
and perhaps many will know more than they have yet done,
of the necessity to endure hardness as good soldiers of Jesus Christ.
Oh, the subtlety of that spirit which is seeking to lay waste and destroy the heritage,
deceive the simple, and cry peace, when there is no peace.

Our dear friends T. and E. Robson have been from home,
principally in the west of England, since the Yearly Meeting.
I suppose they are just about returning.
E+++.+++ R. did not send me thy letter, or write me on the subject; but,
from what I have heard from dear G. and M. Crosfield and others respecting thy troubles,
I was at no loss to know whence they arose.
It cannot be in the right ordering of things,
that the affairs of the Society should be managed by two or three individuals.

May the blessed Head of the church be humbly and
earnestly sought to for wisdom and strength,
and then He who formerly put to flight the armies of the aliens will arise for your help;
but it seems to me that both you and we must suffer more than we have done,
before we shall so humble ourselves before the Lord (as
a people) as to know him to arise and plead his own cause,
eminently and gloriously.
That he will do it, I can have no doubt,
for my faith is unshaken that he will reserve and preserve to himself a living people,
professing the ancient faith of the gospel as held by our primitive Friends,
though scattering and desolation may come upon many.
I believe the promise formerly made will be fulfilled, respecting this people:
"`I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people,
and they shall trust in the name of the Lord.`"

Grubb to J. W.

[.signed-section-context-open]
Lexden, near Colchester, 20th, of 1st mo., 1834.

[.salutation]
My Dear And Valued Friend,

The only letter I ever received from thee bears date 8th mo., 22nd, 1833.
I have perused it repeatedly, and, I think, as often been comforted,
and my faith strengthened by what it conveys.
I know thou must consider it an honor to suffer with
the lowly innocent life of thy dear Lord,
which is now under peculiar (and with respect to our Society) novel persecution.
Was there ever a time among this people,
when the language of the lip of Truth became so applicable?--"`False
Christs and false prophets shall rise,
and shall show signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible,
even the elect;`" but may the little ones be strengthened and encouraged,
seeing that that which comes into obedience to the Truth is ever chosen of God;
and abiding in that which brings to the election, these shall never fall,
but are indeed kept by the power of Him who is mightier than all
that ever did or can oppose itself to his righteous government.
Oh! dear friend, it seems to me that this is indeed a sad time among us in old England.
It falls to my lot still to proclaim war, in the midst of a general cry of "`peace,
peace!`"

Didst thou hear anything of dear Ann Moore standing
up after me in the Yearly Select Meeting?
When I had uttered a warning voice,
and declared that the jealousy of the Lord was kindled
against that spirit which had crept in among us,
to draw away from the ancient and invincible foundation, etc., Ann repeated the text:
"`Oh, thou sword of the Lord! when wilt thou be quiet?
Put thyself up into thy scabbard; rest and be still.
How can it be still?
For the Lord hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the seashore.
There hath he appointed it.`"

This did not fail to produce an expression of disapprobation;
and poor Ann was counselled against siding with me,
or being influenced by us and Thomas Shillitoe;
but she was conscious that none of us had the inclination,
even if we possessed the ability,
to turn her eye from its close attention to the pointings of that unerring Guide,
by which she was brought among us in this land.
I hope this dear handmaiden of the Lord has written to thee since her return home.
She is often deeply proved, and again she comes forth as gold from the furnace.

I wish we had more truly baptized living ministers;
we have copious and eloquent communications from our galleries,
and there is an effect produced on very large audiences that is very striking;
the attention seems riveted to the speaker, and to the subject-matter delivered;
and when the address is closed a solemn silence ensues,
which is as a seal to such ministry.
Is it the seal of our immortal King?
Does his holy hand stamp these offerings, as of his own preparing?
If not, from whence have they their origin?

Alas, I often fear that creaturely activity takes the place
of the movings of the all-enlivening Spirit of Truth,
the holy anointing; with which we have no need that any man teach us;
and to teach and preach in the absence hereof,
seems to me to be even taking the name of the Lord our God in vain.
But what I consider a very awful matter for reflection is,
that should the reality of what we profess in ministry and worship be wanting,
then is it very evident that there is a substitute set up amongst us,
and a substitute too which many times bears an exact resemblance to what comes from God.

Then whence proceeds this likeness?
Must it not be the work and device of "`Mystery Babylon,`" who
can and does disguise herself so as to pass for what she is not?
The eye which is not anointed cannot discover the false
coloring nor the counterfeit gloss of which she is capable.
Is there anything in the true church of Christ,
the likeness of which may not be found in this grand
adept at the deceivableness of unrighteousness?

Many, very many, of our religious community are easily beguiled, being unwary; indeed,
not thinking it possible that those to whom they have been accustomed
to look as "`ensamples to the flock,`" should be misled.
Our dear youth too, are in numerous instances staggered, saying,
which way shall we look for the right path, and who will show us any good?
I trust, however, that the Almighty will be the protection of the humble,
sincere-hearted ones among the children,
gathering their spirits into communion with himself,
evidencing that "`as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings,`"
even so doth he shelter these tender ones from harm.

I often remember thy saying to me, by our fireside at Stoke Newington,
that some of us would be stigmatized as Hicksites; and so it has proved.
Thou expressed thy apprehension of things getting worse before they improved,
which is indeed sorrowfully the case;
nor can I think the magnitude of this evil is yet fully manifest,
there remains such a disposition to cover it up and thus keep it from view.
But, oh,
there is nothing secret that the all-searching spirit
of Omniscience will not bring to light!

A conference has been proposed, again and again, at the Morning Meeting,
and in the Quarterly Select Meeting, but strongly opposed.
Dear Thomas Shillitoe renewed it in our Quarterly
Meeting of ministers and elders last month.
It was then deferred, and on opening the matter this day week, at the Morning Meeting,
some got so irritable, and there appeared such a great reluctance to it,
that we who had wished it yielded.

I thought it right to confess that I could not be tenacious,
remembering that "`the servant of the Lord must not strive,`" expressing, however,
my conviction that the state of things called for an exchange of views,
and free open communication one with another;
for I apprehended that there was increasingly a going off from the sure foundation;
and that which vaunteth itself against the Truth stalketh forth with power,
defying the simple, lowly thing, so long professed by Friends.

J+++.+++ F. spoke to everything many times through the meeting; he is restless,
and appears very zealous in the novel doctrine.
P+++.+++ B., G. S., and W. A. would have been glad had way opened for a conference; indeed,
divers whose cry was to be still, and not think there was any approach to schism,
now see they were mistaken, and that, had the early appearance of danger been arrested,
much mischief might possibly have been avoided.

All this while I have said nothing of a highly talented Friend +++[+++Elisha Bates]
lately come from your land.
Some of us cannot get at him, at least not so as to admit of any freedom of conversation.
He is constantly accompanied by such as are not of the old school.
I+++.+++ B. has travelled with him so far, I believe,
ever since he commenced his visit to this nation,
and now holds a minute from his Monthly Meeting to continue with him,
although he is likely to stop a considerable time in and about London;
but probably thou art in possession of all this from some other pen.

I heard the Friend preach in our Quarterly Meeting;
it was a beautiful exposition of Scripture,
and the doctrines of the New Testament were brought into view, in sublime language;
his delivery is also excellent, yet somehow I felt a chasm which tried me.
In our last Morning Meeting, the said Friend spoke near the close,
in answer to what some of us had ventured to assert as giving us alarm.
I gathered from E. B. that we need not, in his opinion, yield to so much uneasiness,
recommended charity, brotherly love, etc.,
and to "`beware lest any root of bitterness springing up "`should trouble us.
This did not tend to the relief of some of us, but the contrary.
I thought it savored of the same spirit which has for years been opposing
itself to that which lays open our real condition as a people,
in this country.

What a very sad thing it will be should the seceding party gain over E. B. as a champion!
Oh, my dear friend,
I can say that my soul weeps in secret and is troubled for my own dear people!
Surely we are fast mingling with the world at large,
and not a few of the most active are taking retrograde steps, as though,
having begun in the Spirit, we could be made perfect by the flesh.
What a precious pillar must that dear Moses Brown be,
of whom thy letter speaks so sweetly!
How I should like to set my eyes on the patriarchal form!
I am truly glad thou hast such a friend.

These are days of peril among false brethren;
but we do find a few prepared to sympathize with each other,
and to bear one another`'s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
Thou judged rightly in concluding that my dear husband and I have much
to bear in endeavoring to keep firmly to the ancient testimonies of Friends;
we are considered "`very narrow-hearted,
ignorant,`" and "`blind by prejudice;`" but while
we long that self may be of no reputation with us,
we do believe that the straitness is in that which
moves off from the immutable and invincible foundation,
even "`Christ within, the hope of glory,`"--yea,
while there may be great profession of faith in the
outward and visible appearance of him,
our blessed Redeemer, and of his being the propitiation for our sins;
all of which we old-fashioned Quakers as assuredly believe in as the rest,
and possibly feel full as thankful for,
in unfeigned and humble gratitude to him whose name is above every name.

Thou wouldst feel for that dear old servant of our great Master,
(Thomas Shillitoe,) couldst thou see how he is persecuted and set at naught; he, however,
keeps firmly fixed on the Rock of Ages,
against which even "`the gates of hell shall not prevail.`"
I should not wonder if his health gives way under the pressure of deep travail and concern,
not for his own honor, but for that of the unchangeable Truth as it is in Jesus.

Our friend J. J. Gurney has been engaged in his usual line of religious work,
in and about London, for a long time past, taking intervals of rest at home, writing,
etc. etc. Some Friends think him much deepened; I have not yet discovered it.
I always considered him very desirous of promoting good,
but as not having seen so far as the real Friend.
The same applies to his amiable sister E. Fry.
E+++.+++ Dudley is very active with her natural abilities for speaking and doing.
All these latter names I consider as not of the old school; many others I could mention,
ministers and elders, in town and country--east, west, north and south.

I have heard nothing lately of our mutual friend,
Ann Coning--think I shall write to her soon.
I have been engaged in company with my husband, holding public meetings,
and visiting those of Friends in this county and Suffolk.
We received a certificate for the engagement last eighth month;
some objection was started by one member in the Monthly Meeting,
and I know he was not alone in sentiment,
but there was an overpowering expression of unity.
Shouldst thou favor me with another epistle soon, direct--Jonathan Grubb, Lexden,
near Colchester, Essex.

We have been up to London twice to attend our Quarterly Meeting, etc.,
but expect to remain mostly here at our son`'s house, for some months to come.
I find some opposition in Suffolk to the ancient doctrines of Friends;
it has not yet made so much way in this county.
I am indeed exposed to the arrows of the archers in a peculiar manner;
yet can at times rejoice in being permitted to stand against
that which is estranged from the real cross of Christ,
the commonwealth of Israel, although my measure is small, and it is only as,
or "`when I am weak, that I am strong`" in the Lord,
and in the power of his might;--and all the while we are
assured that the cause which we are called upon to advocate,
is not ours, but that of our immortal King, who has no need of us, his poor frail worms,
but who nevertheless calls into his service, in wisdom inscrutable,
and that his power may be exalted, while the creature is laid in the dust.

We have heard but little of Charles Osborn since his return home;
some of our spirits are nearly united to him, a mourner in Zion;
we should be glad to hear of him and dear Christopher Healy.
We have been made thankful in thy peaceful feelings on returning
to the bosom of thy dear family and friends,
yet do not doubt thy having to pass through many baptisms and exercises,
in filling up thy measure of suffering and of active service in the militant Church,
and that the kingdom of a once crucified and forever
glorified Redeemer may prosper in the earth.

The last Yearly Meeting in London was still more strongly marked
by novel doctrine than the one thou wast at the preceding year,
and there was more manifest proof that we were not prepared to "`see eye to eye.`"
I fear the next will find us more widely differing still,
and I should not wonder if the liberal party (so called) are permitted to show
themselves as the "`scornful men`" that ruled in Jerusalem of old,
according to the sacred record; yet,
I believe that the tried foundation--the sure foundation, will be made manifest;
and that it will be seen that many have not forsaken it,
but do know it to be "`a hiding-place in the day of trouble,`"
"`as the shadow of a mighty rock in a weary land.`"
I am not in the habit of much writing,
but thought for once I would make a substitute for verbally communing with a far distant,
yet near and dear brother.
So fare-thee-well.

I am in tender sympathy and regard, thy affectionate friend.

Croydon, near London, 6th mo.
3rd, 1834.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend J. W.

I cannot help feeling it due to thee affectionately
to assure thee of our near love and unity,
if such an assurance from a weak child will be acceptable; yet,
I can speak on behalf of many others hereabouts,
for thou hast very often been in our affectionate remembrance the past year,
and in speaking of thee,
and of the acceptable labor in which thou wast engaged amongst us in this land,
I think I may say, a degree of humble gratitude has covered our minds,
under a sense of His goodness who is the giver of all spiritual help,
who still condescends to visit and to plead with a backsliding people,
sending his messengers from afar with line upon line!
It has been truly refreshing to remember thee and thy two companions in labor,
C+++.+++ Healy and Charles Osborn,
tending to excite in us the desire to be enabled
to walk answerable to your exercise on our behalf.

The letters thou wrote to G. Crosfield are very valuable, and whatever some may say,
I cannot doubt that they have been very helpful in pointing
out to many the precipice towards which they were drawing,
and have been strengthening to many others.
We have felt near sympathy with thee under the trials
which they have no doubt caused thee from some;
but "`wisdom is justified of all her children,`" and if
they have been instrumental in confirming many feeble knees,
and in pointing out the hidden and deep snares of the enemy,
surely there is cause for gratitude!

I expect thou wilt hear from older hands than mine an account of this Yearly Meeting.
It appeared to me very deficient of that solemn silence
in which we are at times permitted to feel,
that He reigns over all and has the praise of all, whose alone right it everlastingly is!
Ah! this solemnizing power--how does one long that we may increasingly
feel the superior value of it above words or declarations of it!
It was truly a suffering time to many,
both from what we felt and heard! yet it was at times comforting to see how some few,
even among the middle-aged,
were strengthened to bear a noble testimony for our ancient principles;
and in some cases were the means of stemming the torrent, as it were.

Ah! my dear friend, will it do to patch all over with love and unity?
it is like trying to unite the iron and the clay in Nebuchadnezzar`'s image.
But perhaps I had better not enlarge further on this subject;
it is a day to sit alone and keep silence--to watch and pray lest we enter into
temptation whilst looking at and lamenting over some of our dear friends,
and mourning over the desolations of our Zion!
May He who has dealt so graciously with us and separated
us to be a people to bear his name before the nations,
turn yet his tender hand upon us, melt us, and try us,
rather than that we should return back to the house of bondage again,
and the holy testimony and standard of Truth, committed to our forefathers,
should be suffered to fall to the ground, as though it had not been anointed!

We feel in a quiet comer here,
although I desire to remember that the unwearied
enemy endeavors to creep into every place,
and that there is no true safety or growth, but in an abiding in Christ the living vine,
who will keep those who trust in him alone in perfect peace in the midst of all shakings!
Dear friend, crave for me that my mind may be so stayed and kept,
and that I may be enabled to bring forth the fruit that the good Husbandman looks for,
to the praise of his great and ever excellent name.

I think I may say respecting dear S. Grubb,
that she had a striking and awful testimony to deliver,
both in ours and the men`'s meeting, as to the state of things amongst us,
also affectionately calling the "`dear children`"
to come away from the Lo! heres and Lo! theres,
to Christ within, where his kingdom is to be found, etc.,
and towards the end she stood up boldly for our ancient views on the subject of prayer,
in opposition to much that has been said inculcating modern views.
Oh! it rejoiced the hearts of many to hear her,
and I trust her burdened mind was a little relieved!
May the Lord of the harvest raise up many more such faithful servants as she is,
qualified by his power alone, and not by human arts and parts!

With the salutation of near love, I remain thy affectionate friend,

Olveston, 6th mo.
3rd,1834.

[.salutation]
My Very Dear Friend John Wilbur,

A packet from Bristol to New York being about to sail in a few days,
I am desirous of availing myself of this near opportunity to acknowledge
the receipt of thy truly acceptable letter of 3rd mo.
23rd. It was very pleasant both to my wife and myself to be remembered by thee,
although it was long looked for; but I conclude that,
travelling so far and widely as thou hast,
correspondents multiply until it is difficult and
laborious to satisfy all their demands.

We should indeed as well as thou be glad to meet again within the confines of mortality,
but such a world of water separates us, that it seems hardly probable,
unless He whom thou serves and who has once anointed thee for this peculiar
work should again in his inscrutable wisdom reanoint for the same service,
and lay the necessity on thee to traverse the ocean once more to proclaim to this nation,
and particularly to our Society, the true foundation on which his church is built,
and that other foundation can no man lay than is already laid even Jesus Christ,
who is also the only head of his own church and the corner-stone thereof.
And he who attempts to get into this church and fold
any other way than by Him who is still the door,
is but "`a thief and a robber.`"

And, my dear friend.
I am greatly afraid that there are many such thieves and robbers,
who have climbed up some other way,
or if they have ever known a right entrance have turned their backs on the revelation
of Jesus Christ and sought to mark out for themselves some new way to the kingdom;
and instead of waiting for the renewed,
and repeatedly renewed inspiration of the Holy Spirit,
as their only authority for speaking in the name of the Most High,
vainly imagine that once called, they can always minister to the people.

But the manna of yesterday is unfit for food today;
it must be received afresh from heaven.
In this way they not only rob God of his honor but rob the people too,
by teaching them to depend on that which is not bread;
and which has not been delivered to them by the great
Head of the Church to feed the people with.
Surely such ministers our God will not own; nor will it profit the hearers.
I am not writing thus for thy information,
but only communicating my feelings to a beloved brother
who I believe has similar views on this subject.
The state of my health for the past five months has been
such as greatly to lessen my ability to bear fatigue,
as well as to bear the weight of that mental exercise which must
fall to the lot of those who keep their proper standing and allotments
in such a meeting as that of our yearly assembly in London.

For every living member has doubtless his allotted station
in the body appointed him by the great Head himself;
and if we are only favored to abide in that station,
occupying the talent or talents committed to us,
I humbly trust we shall be accepted by Him who knows in whose heart it is to serve him.
I believe I can say that I do sincerely and devoutly desire the prosperity of the Truth,
and do in my measure lament the grievous defections of many in our Society;
but I am at times consoled in the conviction that "`Truth is Truth
though all men forsake it,`" and although this is a time wherein
our foundations are tried and proved to the uttermost,
and the enemy of all righteousness is endeavoring
to undermine the very pillars of our faith,
yet we have this precious consolation, "`The Lord knoweth them that are his,
and they shall be his in the day when he maketh up his jewels.`"

My dear friend, with respect to our Society, I regard this as a day of peril,
wherein all who are on the Lord`'s side are like Elijah called
upon boldly to avow their attachment to the true faith.
Oh! may we and all the faithful, both in your land and ours,
be enabled to keep our feet firm on the bottom of Jordan,
for verily this is the only safe place for all the true supporters of the ark.

Would it were in my power to give thee a correct account
of the state of things amongst us as a Society in this nation.
There is evidently much that is amiss in the foremost ranks;
yet there is a kind of cloud over it which to me
has something of the appearance of a dead calm,
before a storm; whether it will burst out in our time remains to be seen;
but it is hard to believe that such discordant sentiments can long keep the peace,
especially with the prevailing desire of the day to be heads and leaders.

Some think themselves, once called, always able to minister without the fresh anointing,
others are unduly exalting the written law,
or giving the Scriptures the preeminence over the internal manifestation
of the same Divine Spirit which gave them forth;
and where the enemy will lead these wandering stars, Omniscience only knows;
but surely in their present state they cannot be settled in the Truth.
It is a fearful thing to contemplate, but, my dear friend,
can we do otherwise than look for a time of sifting,
when the false doctrine shall be separated from the true?

I feel at times as I believe thou and other exercised minds feel, discouraged,
as did Elijah when he said they have slain thy prophets and digged down thine altars,
and I only am left;
yet Divine goodness is sometimes pleased to show these deeply exercised ones,
that there are yet many in Israel who have not bowed
the knee to Baal nor worshipped his image.

Should thy Master see meet to send thee here again,
thou will I believe find a hearty welcome, and most assuredly plenty of work to do;
we want such workmen and such watchmen;
but whether we are permitted to meet again in mutability or not,
it is the prayer of my spirit that we may, when this mortal shall put off mortality,
be favored to obtain the end of our faith, even the salvation of our souls,
by and through Jesus Christ our Lord.

May we be enabled notwithstanding our present trials
to look beyond the scenes of this life,
and with an eye of faith discover the crown immortal, eternal, that fadeth not away,
which can only be obtained at the end of the race;
and may this animate us to press forward even to the end.
My dear Ann joins me in very dear love to thee and thy wife and family,
and desires to add her name and be a partaker in this.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

I have to acknowledge the receipt of thy letter of 6th mo., 20th, from Newport,
which I received on the 14th inst.
The account which thou hast given me of your Yearly Meeting, is very interesting;
and I am obliged to thee for it.
We shall receive John Warren as a brother,
and as one attached to the ancient views of Friends; if he supports those views,
as I trust he will, bonds and afflictions and even persecutions await him in this land.
I hope he will be preserved;
but it is wonderful how some with you have coincided with the innovating class here.

I annex an extract from a letter of James Backhouse,
which I am sure thou will peruse with much interest.
I consider it as most valuable testimony, because it comes from one well able to judge,
and who is entirely removed from all influence of the different
views which have been taken of thy letters.
It has been copied by many Friends, and extensively circulated.
I read it to Elisha Bates and I. Braithwaite; they made no comments,
and often as I have been in E. B.`'s company,
he has never alluded to the letter pro nor con.

[.embedded-content-document.letter]

I have not read through Jaffrey`'s Diary, but am pleased, interested,
and instructed by what I have read.
We are greatly comforted by reading John Wilbur`'s letters;
it is real cause for thankfulness that he has been enabled to point
out the dangers attendant upon the Christian`'s path,
both on the right hand and on the left.
I hope the Divine blessing may rest on his labors,
and that those who have been like to be jostled off the foundation by conflicting views,
may become settled thereon in soundness of faith, doctrine and practice,
and know what it is to have salt in themselves.

If persons would look upon the pages of Holy Scripture,
as direction-posts on the way of the Christian traveller, but not as the way itself,
they would not get far wrong.
And it only says little for the degree in which any have the eyes of their understanding
enlightened when they begin to mistake the direction-posts for the road,
and to fancy that they are travelling on, because they now and then read them.
If they read them without regard to the way they point,
they may read them and even go the wrong way;
but if with diligence they attend to their direction,
and continue to pass on from faith to faith,
they will find that their joy will be greatly increased
by observing that they make progress,
and that their progress is proved by the lessons taught from Holy
Scripture according with those learned in the way of experience,
and those learned in the way of experience according with those taught by Holy Scripture.

Dartmouth, +++[+++Massachusetts,]
8th mo., 7th, 1834.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend John Wilbur,

I may inform thee that we received thy acceptable and satisfactory letters in due season,
and are rejoiced to find that thou art fully aware of the arrows of the archers, and,
we believe, truly sensible wherein thy safety alone depends;
and have no doubt but that thou wilt,
through all the conflicts and deep baptisms which
Infinite Wisdom may see meet to allot unto thee,
experience divine preservation; hid as in the hollow of his holy hand,
from even the noise of archers, as the watch and warfare is on thy part maintained.
I believe my dear husband, feeling and seeing thy exposed situation,
designed those hints more as a watchword than as a reproof for anything he knew.

We feel deeply for thee, as well as for the precious cause of Truth,
greatly desiring thy encouragement,
believing that strength and ability suitable to the day,
will be mercifully afforded unto all those whose meat and whose
drink it is to do or to suffer their Divine Master`'s will.
But it is a day in which the cry for more liberty and conformity is very vehement,
notwithstanding the Holy Scriptures (which these innovators
profess to value very highly) do positively say,
"`Be ye not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your minds,
that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.`"

A sense of these things is affecting and grievous to the rightly exercised,
and causes many, I believe, to go heavily on their way, clad with mourning and sackcloth.
But what different, I would ask, are the followers of a crucified Lord to expect?
Is not this the very path which he, the Lord of life and glory trod,
and did he not forewarn his followers,
that this must be the path of all who would be his disciples,
when he told them that in the world they should have tribulation?
But how sustaining and consoling is the subsequent
language uttered by him at the same time,
"`Be of good cheer, for I have overcome the world.`"

Then let us not, my dear friend, be too much cast down or depressed in spirit,
at the seeing or the hearing of these things;
for verily the Lord will prosper his own work, his honorable and glorious work;
for mighty is his arm, strong is his hand, and high is his right hand!
It does appear to me to be safe,
while we are concerned to endure patiently reproaches and revilings,--yea,
buffetings and scornings,--with all forbearance and meekness and
gentleness and charity--true charity--that we also be concerned
earnestly to contend for the faith once delivered to the saints,
as we feel ourselves authorized by Christ Jesus our heavenly shepherd,
who alone can guide in wisdom`'s paths, and gird with Divine strength for every battle;
shielding with that faith which gives the victory,
and by which alone we are enabled to stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ
hath made us free that we be not again entangled in the yoke of bondage.

Now, I may tell thee what I sometimes think of, and it seems comfortable.
I think I have a little gleam of better days,
for it always appeared to me that buildings, however stately, without good foundation,
were of short duration; because they will not, they cannot, in the very nature of things,
endure trial, but when the fire, the wind,
and the earthquake approach and beat against them, they must fall; and, I believe,
that after all these have spent themselves and are passed away,
a quiet serenity and stillness will succeed;
at which time it will be a season of returning and of gathering unto that
city which hath foundations whose builder and maker the Lord is.

This I pray the Almighty Father to hasten in his own time;
and I do believe that the Lord is yet graciously disposed to build up Zion,
and to strengthen the walls of Jerusalem, and will be, yea is now pleased,
with the sacrifices of righteousness,
and will preserve a remnant who will be found willing
to suffer for the testimonies of Jesus,
concerned to magnify the law, and make it honorable;
even the law of the Lord after the inner man.

Wilt thou not say I have forgotten whom I am addressing?
I am conscious, my dear friend, that thou knowest all these things, and much,
very much more than I can say.
But I trust I shall not give offence;
for I feel often as though I could weep with those who weep,
and rejoice with those who can rejoice in tribulation, in poverty, and desertion,
in having nothing--nothing of their own--no coat or covering that they dare trust to,
or depend upon, but the power and spirit of Jesus Christ,
and yet with this possessing all things needful;
my spirit sympathizes with such wherever scattered, and can bid them God speed.

[.signed-section-context-open]
Croydon, 5th of 10th mo., 1834.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

I fear it will almost seem as if I did not value thy kind communication of the 12th mo.
last, to suffer so long an interval to elapse ere I reply to it.
But be assured this is not the case, far from it.
Thy letter has been in my pocketbook ever since I received it,
which was not till the 5th mo., in order to reply to it,
as well as to have the pleasure of often reading it both to myself and occasionally
to an intimate friend--a poor mourning brother or a sister in the faith.
Most fully do I, and many more,
unite in all thou hast conveyed both in those lines and
in every line I have heard read as coming from thy pen,
and especially in those clear views thou hast received, to give forth, as I do believe,
relative to the state of the church, past, present, and to come.

And my heart, with the hearts of many in this land, does indeed salute thee,
and bid thee God speed on thy journey, travail, and service;
desiring that no man or thing may hinder thee from doing all thou hast,
in thy measure and in thy day, to do for Him and his glory, for his cause and people,
while life and strength are graciously vouchsafed.
Oh, how often have I remembered thee and thought of thee,
as one whom the Lord has made use of in an eminent manner,
while on thy visit in these Islands,
to uncover and bring out to view the working of the wily enemy, as it is this day,
and to manifest the path of the Just One, and the work of God in and among his people.

Thou wilt be pleased to hear (and Oh, that I may continue in the grateful,
humbling sense of these mercies!) that Jaffray has
been almost everywhere very favorably received,
even enemies to the Truth, or those that would prevent it,
acknowledging their admiration at the record therein borne.
I advertised Jaffray pretty largely in periodicals, literary and religious,
and have especially in view those among other Societies who are seeking the best things,
and not settled in their forms.
As surely as I believe the views, which we have ever held, to be according to Truth,
so do I believe, that many up and down are preparing to acknowledge and embrace them;
and that these old-fashioned testimonies which are
advocated in our early Friends`' books,
will come to be admired and nought out, whether our people scout them or not.

Some of those who once were in esteem,
have said Penington`'s writings had better be put into a heap and burned;
while on the other hand, a preacher at Brighton,
who preaches in his own chapel without pay, and is flocked to,
recommended publicly to his hearers Penington`'s Letters,
and in consequence Friends there were applied to for the book!
Oh, surely there is a goodly company without our pale,
who may even take the places and the crowns too of those, be they who they may,
who desert the cause which once was dear to them, and which they honored,
but now seek to undermine, lay waste, or make of none effect,
endeavoring to lower the standard,
and make it square with their own notions and practice.
I have been asked by more than one, standing somewhat high among us, to leave out,
in my 2nd edition of Jaffray, that quotation from thy Letters,
in my notes to the Memoirs of Friends in Scotland; but I inserted it purposely,
and out of a sense of duty, knowing it would not please such as depart,
or are in danger of departing from the faith once delivered to the saints.

There has been a mighty endeavor by all means to salve things over, and heal up all,
and some have seemed in degree to see and recover themselves
out of the snares in which they were all but taken,
and others profess great desires for love and unity, meekness, gentleness, patience,
etc. But on the whole, it does seem to me,
the temptations are more and more seen through by Friends at large,
especially the truly lowly, contrite, little, teachable ones--the poor of the flock.

I have been absent from home three months this summer, in the West,
having liberty for religious service among Friends as way might open;
and found myself obliged to join hands with a beloved Friend,
in visiting the families of Friends in Falmouth Monthly Meeting.
And in that engagement, as well as everywhere, I had occasion to notice,
that though the standing of many seems in slippery places and on shifting ground,
and many of understanding may yet fall, there is, nevertheless, a worthy remnant,
whose hands, though hanging down,
I trust will not let go their hold of that which they have truly handled,
and know to be their only hope, and strength, and safety.

Dear William Byrd is yet living, and alive in the Truth, though very helpless,
laid on a sofa by day, yet cheerful, calm, and clear in his intellect.
Samuel Rundell of Liskeard, and Sarah Tucker, are veterans,
and quite aware of the mode of warfare now abroad.
The former has published, at Yearly Meeting time, "`Observations on Redemption, Worship,
Ministry, Supper,`" etc.--a pamphlet thou wouldst value I think.
It is for those not Friends, but hits many points in which Friends are implicated,
and is likely to be reprinted, and I am now in correspondence with him upon it,
having had it in hand before.

Poor Ann Tweedy seemed bowed in mourning greatly,
feeling like many others of us day and night, how things are tending and verging,
though very quietly and artfully, and to many almost imperceptibly.
No convulsion awaits us, as with you; it might be better for us if it were so.
No, no; the enemy is wiser than to foment this; he would not hurt us for the world; no,
only let us be induced to give up the true foundation for another,
and he promises so gently and peaceably to glide us on it, that we shall not know it,
except that it will be less rugged and hard to flesh and blood,
without any cross or struggle,
and there shall be nothing taken from us that we affect to prize,
such as our customs and traditions, our church system, and so forth,
nothing shall be disturbed of all this, and all the professors and the world too,
shall love us the better!

A new edition of J. J. Gurney`'s Peculiarities, with additions,
has passed a committee of the Morning Meeting, of which I was one.
Oh, it made my heart sick to attend it, only that my Master whispers,
"`All these things must needs come to pass--but see that ye be not troubled.`"
A Friend that I have been accustomed to look up to, as to a mother in Israel,
actually said on one occasion,
when we came upon something of very doubtful and dangerous import,
that many years back she should have found a difficulty in the passage,
and she thought the Society at large was, perhaps,
not prepared to receive it as it stood; yet she acknowledged the truth of it,
but thought it had better be somewhat modified!

Ah! my friend, the language is, "`I will show thee yet greater abominations than these.`"
And in this book of which I speak,
thou mayst see far more open palpable proof (in an additional
chapter on worship and ministry) that thy sentiments,
expressed in thy "`Letters,`" are indeed true, or rather short of the whole truth.
It is needful I should say, I protested in my feeble way,
against the tendency of the whole chapter, telling the committee and the author,
that the contrast was strong between that and Barclay`'s Apology.
The Morning Meeting is, however,
dissatisfied that works should be examined by a committee,
so that I hope the rule will be altered next year.

The above mentioned Friend +++[+++J.J. G.]
has been visiting families in our Quarterly Meeting for a long time at intervals,
and especially giving lectures on religious subjects;
which is a sort of new gift that has sprung up in these days,
wherein the performer has more liberty to follow the divination of his own brain,
than in speaking by immediate revelation,
as the Spirit lays under a necessity and gives ability and utterance;
thus there is more room for the creature to take a part.
I have not attended any; but they have been flocked to by Friends and others,
who are generally much taken with the plan.
We heard yesterday, in the Meeting for Sufferings,
that John Warren is arrived at Liverpool.
Oh, that he may be instructed, and led along in safety,
preserved and strengthened to espouse the holy cause, and refresh the poor heritage!

As to E. Bates, who is just about setting sail from our shores,
it is my painful belief he has been sadly misled, as to the state of things in this land,
supposing we were in danger from Hicksism;
and he has been sheltered under the wing of those
who have carefully kept him from being undeceived.
Oh, how instructive it is to see that the most eminently gifted instruments
are only really useful while in the Divine hand and ordering;
and that the Almighty is not bound to work by them but as he sees meet;
and he can raise up striplings, that so no flesh should glory.

It is the distinguishing feature of this heresy, that it runs among the rich, the great,
the learned, the eloquent, the spiritually gifted, and highly experienced;
and these in our land are connected by various ties,
almost from one end of the kingdom to the other; so that they generally bear rule,
where things are carried by respect of persons, or other inferior consideration.
My dear brother Rawlinson sees more and more into these things;
he likewise has been travelling through many northern counties,
for the benefit of his health in part, and has been much at large meetings,
and among the chief folks.
He says the withering tendency of these new views is already beginning to appear,
and will, he believes, more and more.

He speaks of having encountered some that have been as pillars,
and it astonished him how soon they were silenced,
and how little they could substantiate against the early Friends and their doctrines.
Speaking of a great meeting in Westmoreland,
and of a Friend with whom he had a tough discourse,
he writes that he appeared on the 1st day in both meetings;
"`but such a drowsy afternoon meeting I do not remember to have attended anywhere.
Before me (for I faced the meeting) and behind me,
the process of nodding was going forward!
Alas, surely if the word of faith is not preached--the word nigh in the heart,
how chilling must be the ministry in Quakers`' meetings, for worship!`"
All this will not surprise thee, my dear friend.--Oh,
that all who are not with us would even go out from us, and show their true colors;
it would be more honorable than to be endeavoring to insinuate something else among us,
which our fathers could not, neither can we adopt; nay, which we have protested against,
and came out from, when we became a people.

Dear Thomas Shillitoe was taken poorly at P. Bedford`'s,
and was prevented being at our Quarterly Meeting, but is better again.
He told me, after the Select Meeting, there was nothing too bad to expect in these times;
and truly I much question whether some who can speak abundance
about what our blessed Saviour has done for them,
having forsaken or slighted his witness in the conscience, can,
notwithstanding all their high profession, be trusted for common honesty and sincerity.

There is a want of simplicity uprightness, straightforward acting;
and it manifests itself in our meetings for discipline, in political expediency,
maneuvering, and subtle unworthy ways of getting things passed in meetings.
From what I understand, things are more as could be wished in Ireland than here,
and those they send us, as representatives stand their ground firmly,
and are a real help to us.
Farewell, my beloved friend;
may the Most High be our shield and our exceeding great reward,
and a very present help in trouble.
With dear love, in which my wife and sister Lydia unite, I remain thy sincere friend,

[.signed-section-context-open]
Hopkinton, 2nd mo., 20th, 1835.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend Sarah Tucker,

I will now acknowledge that for more than half a year,
I have been indebted to thee for thy truly comfortable
and interesting salutation received at Portsmouth,
and a sweet repast it proved as we travelled on the way from thence towards Providence.
And how refreshing indeed, and strengthening too,
to trace in the communications of a dear friend that which meets the witness in ourselves,
and answers as face to face in a glass;
strikingly indicative of the mercy and goodness of our Heavenly Father,
not only in permitting,
but in wisely ordering a union of feeling in the covenant
of the everlasting gospel among all his children,
from the least unto the greatest.

This makes them rejoice in the excellency of his love which
so exceedingly enlarges our hearts towards him,
and abundantly tends to quicken our feelings, and to bring us near one to another--yea,
and mutually to desire the building up and establishment of one another
in "`the obedience of faith,`" and upon a foundation which never faileth.
How precious, my dear friend does this look to me, and how thankful do I desire to be,
that the blessed Giver of every good and perfect gift,
has given me many beloved brothers and tender sisters;
and disposed them by the power of that love which pervades his whole heritage,
and gathers unto himself,--to desire and to intercede for my preservation!

The prayers of the righteous are declared to avail much; but then I need not say to thee,
that God must have the glory and honor of our preservation,
if indeed we are favored with that unspeakable gift.
But truly my dear friend,
thou also knowest that unless we watch continually and pray fervently for ourselves,
and for the angel of his presence to be encamped round about us,
all the prayers of all the saints in the militant church will not keep us!
Then how clearly we see the propriety of annexing to our prayers for one another,
the exhortation, of, "`Stand fast in the Lord, and let no man take thy crown.`"
O the temptations, assaults, and buffetings of our souls`' enemy!
He seems to be stalking abroad as at noonday, seeking for prey which he may devour!
Then how needful for the servants of the Lord to dwell in his light which will
detect the adversary in his every movement and in his every transformation;
and to live and to dwell very near to Him whose power
alone can protect us against the delusions,
as well as against "`the fiery darts of the wicked one.`"

Although my life for these several years past, has been,
very much a life of mourning and a season of lamentation,
on account of the seductions of the enemy,
and the inroads which he is making in our Zion,
yet I am bound to say that the Lord has been very gracious,
and in the midst of my despondings, sometimes for myself, and some, times for the Church,
has removed, at seasons, all doubt of the sufficiency of his grace or of his power,
and encouraged my soul to trust in him.
In some of these seasons it has been made manifest to my understanding,
that everlasting kindness will not suffer anything
to befall his obedient and truly dependent children,
that will do them any harm;
as they are faithful--keep the word of his patience and trust in him.

When thus, through unmerited mercy, my mind has been strengthened to trust in the Lord,
and to rejoice for a season in his salvation,
then my own trials and individual sufferings have appeared as but a drop from the bucket,
compared to the afflictions which do rest, and, as I apprehend, will increasingly rest,
upon all the faithful testimony bearers in our Israel.
Will not the cries of these,
lifted up day and night be graciously heard of the Lord of Sabaoth, and regarded by him,
as they lie very low before him and confess their own nothingness and
unworthiness as well as insufficiency to do anything without him;
and are also willing to endure hardness for his blessed
name`'s sake--to do whatsoever he calls for at their hands,
and careful to do no more.

By the prayers and faithfulness of these I trust, my dear sister,
the Redeemer of the world will send forth his power,
to the saving alive and to the sparing, at least of a remnant of his people.
And if they will count nothing too dear to give for the exaltation of his testimonies,
he will cause the life and power of his blessed presence to abound in them,
and to go along with them,
to the pulling down of some of the strong-holds of the destroyer.

[.signed-section-context-open]
"`Henry Freeling`"--Papieta Bay, Island of Otaheite, 5th mo.
21st, 1835.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend, John Wilbur,

Although much time has elapsed since we saw each other at Norwich in England,
and though many have been the turnings and overturnings
of my heavenly Lord and Master`'s hand since that day,
yet at seasons I have never ceased to remember thee,
in the fresh aboundings of that love, the precious influence of which,
binds together in one, the disciples of the one crucified, risen and glorified Lord,
however distant from each other their lot may be cast.

Thou mayest probably have heard something,
(though I doubt it as I write,) of the fight of affliction
and distress which I had to endure,
within the borders of my own beloved family,
which deprived me of the beloved partner of all my joys and sorrows,
and a faithful sharer in them for more than thirty-two and a half years.
What my Master did, I knew not at the time, but have since known,
to the comfort and consolation of my tribulated mind,
and to the praise and glory of his grace.
"`What I do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter.`"
And persuaded I am, renewedly, that every dispensation of his holy will towards me,
was only to prepare me for the great work in which I am now engaged;
and to set the captive spirit more and more free from every earthly care,
and to wean it from the near and dear social tie,
and render it more fit to be employed in the highest, greatest,
and most noble calling upon earth, even in a cause, dignified with immortality,
and crowned with eternal life.

In addition to this heavy trial, which took me back across the continent of Europe,
a winter`'s journey, twenty-eight days in length,
once more to behold the wreck of my precious family, and regulate their affairs,
for their future well-being, the messengers of Satan,
(for they were many) were let loose to buffet me.
After the vessel "`Henry Freeling,`" from which I now address thee, was fitted out,
we sailed from London on the thirteenth of eleventh mo., 1833,
and joined her a few miles below Gravesend;
and eventually proceeded from there to Portsmouth,
in the neighborhood of which we were detained more than four months,
by strong adverse gales, and other circumstances,
but all tending eventually to promote the great object in view; and I fully believe,
"`working together for good.`"
During this long detention, in the winter months, our little bark,
of about one hundred tons only, was often tempest-tost without,
and some on board often tempest-tost within.

After having been here about a month, my mind was sorely exercised,
and there was but one way for me to throw it off, to my relief;
and this was by making an open avowal, that I was not satisfied to proceed any further,
let the consequences be what they might,
with the Friend appointed by the "`Meeting for Sufferings`" in London,
as an assistant--or by some termed a companion, but not by myself.
This circumstance seemed to raise a "`hue and cry`"--or something like it,
against me in almost every part of England; and at length,
drew down a committee appointed by the "`Meeting for Sufferings`" to visit me at Portsmouth,
viz: Peter Bedford, George Stacey, Josiah Yorster of Tottenham, and Samuel Gurney;
bringing with them the final determination of a Meeting
for Sufferings specially convened on the occasion,
which was--that I should be left at liberty to proceed on
the voyage without any further companion than my son Charles,
(about twenty-four years of age,) who believed it
his duty to resign his situation in Russia,
(all the living that he had,) and surrender himself to the Divine disposal,
by making the offer of going with me,
and of making himself useful in any way that might present,
if approved by Friends in London; and this was accepted by the generality of Friends,
as far as I know; but the conduct of Daniel Wheeler in this business was considered,
from north to south, to be highly reprehensible,
if not shameful,--to use the said Friend in the manner I had done.

They wanted a reason, and I could give them none;
but that I had acted under a sense of duty.
This could not be reconciled.
It was not understood by those who never heard the Master`'s voice, at any time,
or saw his shape; and I fear it may be said, believe not in him.
Of this description I am aware thou art not ignorant;
there are not a few in our Society in England.
I think they cannot be better pointed out than by my saying,
they were such as highly disapprove of "`John Wilbur`'s
Letters,`" published by George Crosfield,
of which I am thankful, in having several copies now along with me.

But what puzzled these people most of all,
was that the Friend and myself parted in brotherly love.
There had at no time been any difference existing between us,
and I quite thought that he had been right in making the offer, at the outset,
inasmuch as he had promoted my being set at liberty by the "`Meeting for Sufferings,`"
which would not have been the case if another Friend had not offered himself,
as neither the outfit nor the purchase of the vessel would have been entered into,
until one had showed himself.

When we separated at Portsmouth, he gave me as handsome a clearance in writing,
as I could desire, or wish for; and in a letter to the Monthly Meeting at Balby,
(near Doncaster,) to which we both belong as members,
I had also given him full satisfaction, and the meeting too,
as well as the "`Meeting for Sufferings,`" which had been furnished, by myself,
with a copy of the said letter.
Moreover, when sifted by some friends who wanted to get information from him, he,
in the same noble manner, declared that if he had it to do again,
he would still do the same; but even this could not satisfy.
I received letter after letter reproaching me for my conduct,
and declaring that my going had not their unity;
and one Friend did not hesitate to express his belief
that the Divine presence was withdrawn from me,
that I was left to myself,
and that the detention and other circumstances combined to declare it.

At one time I concluded to return to London, and meet these enemies, face to face,
but something continually occurred to prevent my taking this step, when ready to set out.
Some of my true friends approved of it, and others dreaded the result.
I was, however, favored to see through this snare of the enemy,
for I fully believe if I had gone again to London,
the voyage would have been set aside altogether;
as I am satisfied that it would have caused a complete
exposure of the principles of many among us,
and a complete explosion also; and I was not desirous to shrink from going,
on this account, but the language in my mind was,
"`Let the dead bury their dead--but go thou!`"

I believe many Friends could see the divine Hand in all this,
as it occasioned my writing many letters, in support, I humbly trust,
of the Truth as it is in Jesus.
The detention also afforded time for our captain`'s character to be fully developed,
and another to be appointed in his place.
It was thought afterwards by many, and particularly by myself,
that we had not been detained one day too long.
I must pass over all particulars of the voyage; however,
on leaving the neighborhood of Portsmouth,
we reached our anchorage in the harbor of Rio de Janeiro
in Brazil,--without making a single tack,--a thing,
perhaps, never done before by any vessel.

Farewell, my very dear friend.
My dear love awaits thee and thine, and all those that in sincerity love the Lord Jesus,
in which my Charles would gladly join, and believe me thy affectionate friend.

[.signed-section-context-open]
Hopkinton, 9th mo., 8th, 1835.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friends James and Sarah Tucker,

Although I have not received a line from your hands since I last wrote,
for which omission I have no doubt but you have had sufficient reason,
yet having now a good opportunity by my niece, and feeling too, as I trust,
a continuance of that love which has many times, even when absent,
brought you very near to me--I am willing to renew the salutation of it,
in a covenant which I hope will never end;
for I am persuaded that you are of that number who are desiring,
according to the strength which may be given,
to support and even advance the Lord`'s cause among his people.

And I rejoice in believing that there are yet in
the Church those who are faithful "`In labors,
in watchings, in fastings; by pureness, by knowledge, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost,
by love unfeigned, by the word of Truth, by the power of God,
by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, by honor and dishonor,
by evil report and good report; as deceivers and yet true; as unknown and yet well known;
as dying and behold they live; as chastened and not killed; as sorrowful,
yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing,
and yet possessing all things.`"
May the Church under our name never be wanting of those who can set their seals to this
striking description of the humble and true Christian`'s experience.

To the living members of the body it is no mystery--to you, my dear friends,
it needs no interpretation.
Well, my friends, however depressed with a sense of our own weaknesses,
however laden with infirmities, let us look confidently to Him on whom help is laid,
let us nevertheless press forward towards the mark for the
prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus our Lord,
in the faith of the everlasting covenant; then will he be to us strength in weakness,
riches in poverty, and a present help in the time of need.

And when the deepest baptisms are administered by the hand of the Lord,
or suffered through any medium whatever,
then shall we witness judgment brought to the line, yea, as it may be, in the midst,
or with our feet standing upon the very bottom of the River of Judgment.
Then shall we be prepared also to see righteousness
and uprightness invariable with the plumb line;
we shall be quick-sighted and of ready discernment,
not only to see a little of the purposes of heavenly Wisdom,
but of the mystery of iniquity, and its working in the children of disobedience.

And then, however deep and constant our concern for the safety of our own souls,
we shall sometimes witness this concern to be swallowed
up of one which is greater and higher,
even for the safety of the Church of Christ and for her testimonies.
In such a concern,
his loyal subjects have not been wont to account their own lives dear to themselves,
when compared with the ministry which they have received of Christ
Jesus to testify of the gospel of the grace of God.

And now I feel free to say to you, my dear friends,
as to those whom I know will be discreet in knowledge,
that my fears regarding things on the other side of the water are being lamentably realized;
that such as my labors there, both by word and writing, were designed to counteract,
are notwithstanding very likely to prevail to an alarming degree;
and whether the Society there will be able to purge itself by a copious dismemberment,
or whether a disjunction will take place,
or whether the leaven will be suffered to remain till the whole be leavened,
as was the case with the primitive Church, when it graduated into apostasy,
is yet uncertain.

The unsoundness is far the most prevalent amongst the wise, the rich,
the learned and the influential;
which renders it exceedingly difficult to raise the authority of Truth above it.
The avowal and development of their views were issued forth (in the "`Beacon
"`) by a person living in a Monthly Meeting where their strength was great,
so that the author could not there be dealt with.
But the Quarterly Meeting, by a great exertion of the faithful members,
did appoint a committee to assist the Monthly Meeting in dealing and placing judgment.
And it is said that the Quarterly Meeting,
on account of the strength it had to contend with, applied to their last Yearly Meeting,
and that the Yearly Meeting appointed a committee to assist the Quarterly Meeting.

But unhappily (as I greatly feared) several of those influential
characters--such as above alluded to--were nominated on the committee.
By recent information we learn that the committees
both met at Lancashire Quarterly Meeting;
and all that I can understand to have been done was,
that the Yearly Meeting`'s committee requested the Quarterly
Meeting`'s committee not to act without its permission.
So that things stand in a very unpleasant suspense.
But after all there is one favorable circumstance, namely,
the disavowal of the Beacon by the Morning Meeting in London.

Nevertheless the aspect of things there looks fearful; and that fearfulness,
or the occasion of it, has extended itself to these shores.
Sometimes the sallies from sound Christian doctrine are in one direction,
and sometimes in another; the object and aim at this time seems to be,
to divide and distinguish Christ from his own spirit.
Such assertions as the following are now to be met
with repeatedly,--if ministers and elders,
and others both of our own parts and strangers are to be credited--namely,
that "`the Spirit of Truth is no part of a Saviour;`" "`that Christ only,
and him crucified, is to be preached;
that these pretensions of the Light and the Spirit must vanish away,`" etc. etc.

But the advocates for such assertions and for such a preacher,
say that he is entirely sound,
and that the difficulty rests wholly upon our want
of understanding him,--an apology as you will recollect,
very similar to one frequently made on behalf of another innovator some ten years ago,
about New York and Philadelphia.
I am thinking, that if the wise and learned cannot speak so as to be understood,
whether they would not do well, to give place to the ignorant and unlearned,
whose declarations are seldom if ever misunderstood;
especially if their motives are pure and their anointing of the Lord,
as were those of Peter, James and John.

I remain your friend and brother in tribulation,

[.salutation]
Dear Friend John Wilbur,

I have nothing new from England.
Our friend T. T. has either thought best not to write, or the letter has miscarried.
I expect his mind is under much discouragement and perplexity
on account of the state of things among them,
and well indeed it may be, for where is our Society in a state of settlement,
holding the authority and power in the Truth that it did in the
days that are past--to be sure something remains among us,
but the seed is under oppression and sorely distressed in many places.
I learn that things at the school are no better.
Poor Seth and Mary have a fiery trial and my soul sympathizes with them deeply;
I have trod their path and know it well.
When that which was once known in our Society as
skill and wisdom degenerates into maneuver and stratagem,
it is time things were stopped and resumed on a more honest plan.

Hannah Backhouse and Anna Thorn are now about twelve days on their passage,
and if they have had the weather as we have had it, they must have had a pleasant time.
I wrote to Anna while she was in New York,
and gave her such advice as I thought might be beneficial to her on the passage,
and in England, and particularly cautioned her against too close intimacy,
in which the natural part was apt to be caught, and true vision obstructed.
Friends here are generally well.
Seeing Peter Collins in town this morning,
I thought I would salute thee as a brother in exercise for the welfare of the Church.

Hopkinton, 1st of 1st mo., 1836.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend Mary Davis,

The various and very peculiar trials and afflictions
which have fallen to the line of thy experience,
and to that of thy dear husband,
have truly induced many brotherly feelings of sympathy and commiseration in my mind;
and so far as I have been capable I have craved your preservation and support,
through all the enmity and buffetings of Satan.
Oh! how the cruel enemy strives to beguile and to destroy
the disciples of a crucified Lord--to sift them as wheat;
but how consoling and strengthening the Lord`'s intercessions for Peter:
"`I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not.`"

And certainly, my dear Mary, He whose mercies fail not, but are new every morning,
will not leave thee, nor forsake thee in the day of trouble and anguish of spirit,
which he has suffered to overshadow thee, as the clouds overshadow the earth;
for as thy trust is in him, and thy cries are mightily lifted up,
his ear is open to hear, and he will break through the clouds and melt them away.
He will fill thy dwelling with his radiance, peace and love.
He will encamp round about thee by the angel of his presence,
and cause thy enemies to be at peace with thee,
as a glorious reward for a faithful endurance of hardness as a good soldier,
and an ample remuneration for days and months, nay, even years of the keenest anguish.

Well, my dear friend, I rejoice not that sore tribulations have fallen to thy lot,
(or I might say to your lot,
for I believe that Seth has had his part with thee,) but I rejoice
in believing that the grace of God is sufficient for you,
is sufficient in the greatest of straits and deepest of wadings:
sometimes in standing still, (as at his command) we shall see his salvation;
and sometimes in turning the battle to the gate,
his strength will be our crown and victory.

And again, though I have sorrowed in your sorrows,
yet I do rejoice that such as you succeeded E. and L.
+++[+++in charge of the boarding-school at Providence]
for certainly, if persons of the new views had taken the superintendency,
the consequences would have been (in my apprehension) truly forlorn.
And inasmuch as I entertain some fears in relation to thy health,
and the endurance of thy patience in so painful and arduous a service,
I still feel many forebodings as to the continued usefulness and safety of that institution;
for when you leave, if the present influence continue,
persons of a different cast will undoubtedly be sought for to fill your place.

And whether we shall be able with such influence in the committee, even with you,
or any other sound Friends at the head of the family to
preserve the school from gross defection in principle,
is at best very doubtful;
and I presume there is no section anywhere in the Yearly Meeting,
where the dissemination of unsound principles would
so much contribute to destroy Quakerism in New England.
It is indeed a day of great fearfulness and much
trembling for the safety of the ark of our testimonies,
lest the enemies of our Israel should overcome, and the ark of God be taken.
Should such unhappily be the case,
then judgment will certainly rest upon the house of Eli,
or those whose sins may be the cause of such reproach in Israel.

Farewell my dear friend, and may He on whom help is laid be near,
yea be with thee and thy dear husband,
and keep and comfort you with the sweet incomes of his goodness,
and stablish you upon the immutable foundation;--and remember in your most tried moments,
that you have a friend who loves you,
and hopes that your prayers and his will continue to be mutual.

Dartmouth, 1st mo., 19th, 1886.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

I acknowledge there may have been some cause for thee to
suspect that we were grown rather cool and indifferent,
in regard to answering thy communications, as some time has elapsed since we wrote.
But can assure thee it is not so, for thy letters were truly acceptable,
interesting and comforting to our poor minds,
and would long ago have been replied to by me,
if I had thought that anything I could write would have been worthy of thy perusal.

I have been, much of the time, confined in consequence of ill-health,
and sometimes felt so poor and destitute of right materials for profitable writing,
that I have scarcely dared to attempt such a thing.
Yet I have often remembered thee, and now feeling, as I apprehend,
a little of that love which unites the hearts of poor pilgrims,
who are laboring and travailing, in spirit,
to obtain a better and more enduring inheritance--who
through faith and patience are striving and wrestling,
even as it were in the night season, for the blessing,
the new name and the white stone--am willing again to resume my pen,
hoping that it may at least serve as a fresh token of our unfeigned friendship
and fellowship with thee in the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
And I pray that this may continue forever on that ground,
whereby we shall be enabled always, whether present or absent,
to be one another`'s helpers, yea, joy and rejoicing in the Lord.

Although I do not go much abroad,
and am much secluded from my friends--particularly so this winter--that
I get but little information how the times are;
yet it seems to me that it is rather a low, poor time in the general,
and this poverty I fear is not the worst; is it not a season of distress,
of great perplexity, of darkness, and of treading down,
a day in which we are called to mourning and lamentation! and in which the priests,
the Lord`'s ministers, have to weep, as between the porch and the altar, saying,
"`Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine heritage to reproach?`"

Such, indeed, are my feelings,
but most gladly would I be informed that I am altogether mistaken.
But, notwithstanding, my dear friend, I do feel, at seasons, some encouragement;
a little light now and then breaks forth,
by which it is clearly seen that all those who adhere to good old Joshua`'s resolution,
let others do as they may, they will serve the Lord, and that in his own way,
(which is the way of the Cross,) and not in the will and wisdom of the natural man;
will be preserved, although sharp may be their conflicts, and deep their baptisms.
Yet He who knoweth those who are his,
who beholdeth purity of intention and cleanness of heart with Divine approbation,
will not suffer a hair of their head to be hurt; so that amidst all the commotions,
the jars and the rents, the ups and the downs, within our borders,
I humbly trust and believe that a precious remnant will escape,
whose lives will be given them for a prey.

O! that thou mayst not faint or give back in the day of battle,
when called upon to stand for the faith,
even that precious faith which was once delivered to the saints.
I believe thou hast nobly stood therefor, and that thou wilt continue to do so,
whatever thou mayst suffer;
and it seemed as if I might just offer thee a word of encouragement,
as I feel it to arise at this time,
although I know I am addressing one whose experience in all those things doth far,
very far, exceed my own.

Thou art not alone, I can assure thee, in thy tribulated path;
I believe there are not a few who are in the same way,
who go bowed down all the day long, whose hearts are pained within them,
who are dismayed at the seeing and hearing of those things which
are floating within the borders of our once highly favored Society.
Indeed, is not this the language of some of the little remnant,
"`Oh! that mine head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears,
that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people?`"
In my retired moments my heart is sometimes raised in desire and humble prayer to the
God and Father of all our sure mercies for the prosperity of the true Church,
that her broken walls may be repaired and her desolated gates again set up,
her stakes strengthened and her cords lengthened--that she may yet break forth,
both on the right hand and on the left, and may yet shake herself from every defilement,
and thus become an eternal excellency, the joy of the whole earth!

Providence, 5th mo., 6th, 1836.

Thy last salutation, my dear friend, was received in due season,
and was truly cordial to my mind,
bringing with it a savory evidence of that which unites in one and makes glad
the hearts of those who love the blessed appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ;
and by this renewed evidence and assurance I feel
no reserve at all in writing freely to thee,
as to a sister beloved, in the bonds of gospel love and fellowship,
in Him who hath in his tender mercies favored us to drink together of the one spirit.

I have read thy letter again and again,
and I can assure thee that as oft as I have read it I have been refreshed and comforted;
and now, while writing,
I am made to feel thankful to the God and Father of all our sure mercies that there
are here and there to be found those who are travelling and laboring together,
in the spirit of their minds, for the safety of the Lord`'s people,
and for the keeping of his testimonies.
My desire and prayer for this precious few, is,
that they may not only receive their daily supplies of strength
from the everlasting and inexhaustible Fountain of life and power,
but by "`often speaking one to another,`" and communing one with another,
as well secretly as expressively, they may be a strength one to another.

And I do account it a great favor that personal separation and
distance in the world cannot deprive these of such sweet communion;
they are often led by the same blessed Hand, sometimes to the test of their faith,
in the deep waters of Jordan,
and sometimes to a full confirmation of it by marvellous deliverances.
These become thereby qualified, in the living experience of God`'s providences,
to be helpful in "`building one another up in the most holy faith.`"
Well, then, my beloved sister and fellow traveller,
let us avail ourselves of his mercies in permitting us to joy in one another`'s joys,
as well as to sorrow in one another`'s sorrows.

And although more constantly watching over ourselves,
and engaged in intercessions for our own preservation,
yet these exercises are sometimes swallowed up in the greater concern
for the keeping and spreading of the testimonies of Truth,
and the preservation of the Lord`'s people everywhere.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend John Wilbur,

Thine of the 26th ult.
did not reach me until the 4th inst.
It was very acceptable,
and I can respond sincerely to thy feelings on account of the state of our Society,
both in Europe and America.
It is, indeed, "`Watchman! what of the night?`"
and I believe it is somewhere said in Scripture, "`What of the day?`"
for both our night and our day are gloomy and appalling.
But it does not seem as if it will quite answer to give up and let all go by the board.

I have received probably all the information from England that thou hast.
Lately has come to hand a parcel and a pretty long letter from T. T. Among the things
sent was the printed Report of the Yearly Meeting`'s Committee to the Monthly Meeting.
On reading it I was reminded of old Robert Knowles, who,
when a person told him that "`he was an unaccountable original,`"
went home and told the family that "`a man had said something about
him which he could not decide to be for him or against him.`"

On reading the forepart of this report, it looked much as if it was right and decided;
but was exceedingly neutralized at the close.
In the parcel is also Richard Ball`'s wicked book,
entitled "`Holy Scripture the Test of Truth,`" which
is all plain and flat in the face of Barclay,
Penn, and Hancock.
I learn that John Wilkinson, at a meeting at Tottenham, lately, said,
"`Let not those who believe in an inward light, think they believe in Christ,
for every infidel believes in an inward light.`"
T+++.+++ Shillitoe followed him and said,
"`If there is not an inward light with which I have been acquainted these sixty years,
I am now, when on the brink of the grave,
in a most deplorable condition`"--and then proceeded
in a very good and appropriate testimony.

Soon after,
he was at another meeting where J. Wilkinson advocated the propriety of judicial oaths,
and was spoken to by a woman Friend,
who told him she was sorry to have the meeting disturbed with such remarks,
and requested him to desist, which he did not do,
and another Friend repeated the request for him to sit down, which he did;
and at the next Monthly Meeting that occurred he and his
wife requested to be dismissed from the Society.

I have not thought of going to Philadelphia Yearly Meeting,
but if thou hast a mind to go thou hast my unity in so doing,
and hope thou wilt attend to it.
Affectionately,

[.salutation]
Dear Friend John Wilbur,

It is now sometime since I saw thee or heard from thee, and, now in the opening,
the prospect is not very large of communication;
arising much from the apprehension that thy friends in England
freely communicate with thee on the state of things with them.
My letters from there have been quite frequent of late,
and it looks to me that another Yearly Meeting there must result in a separation,
though it is said the "`Evangelical Friends,`" as they call themselves,
are agreed in nothing among themselves,
excepting to remain with Friends and give them as much trouble as they possibly can.
Those who have resorted to the weak and beggarly elements,
still remain with the Society and attend meetings for business; and in Kendal,
the Assistant Clerk of the Quarterly Meeting, though of this description,
continues to keep his seat at the table,
yet the resignation of Anna Braithwaite`'s daughter, after being some time withheld,
has been accepted by the meeting.

Elisha Bates has published his reasons for being baptized, as he calls it,
in a very simple mode, by Dr. Smith, at Homerton, in or near London; that is,
he was sprinkled, and considers he never received Christian baptism until this was done.
His reasons are published in a pamphlet, which I have,
and should not desire anything better to refute him than his own words,
contained in his Doctrines under the head Baptism, etc.,
which is now being republished in the Friend;
and it seems to me it will not be very palatable to him to eat his own words.

In his Reasons, etc.,
his weakness and his nakedness and the shame of his nakedness most strikingly appear.
It seems to me a good writer might expose him to his great discomfiture,
although he has displayed much ingenuity and adroitness,
and also assumed much humility of himself and concern for the Society,
for which he says his love has much increased.
But not doubting the same may have reached thee, I shall say no more about him,
save that we learn he has arrived in this country.

In New York he stayed but a short time; he was invited to dine at Samuel Wood`'s,
by his sons.
While there he manifested much uneasiness or agitation of mind.
In Philadelphia, he stayed but about three hours,
and I do not learn that he spoke with any Friend while there.
I have heard that some prominent individuals at Mt. Pleasant
have renounced him since his baptism--Benjamin Wright,
in particular; but there are some others in that neighborhood who are, I fear,
as wild as himself, and there is no knowing to what lengths they will go.

I have lately had a good letter from Joshua Lynch, and another from dear old John Heald,
but both letters were previous to Elisha`'s arrival in this country.
They are both alive and aware of the dangers which await our poor and distressed Society.
John`'s letter was peculiarly sweet and acceptable,
as from his age and many infirmities I never expected
again to have seen the traces of his pen.

The Yearly Meeting`'s Committee have recommended the case
of Isaac Crewdson to the care of his Monthly Meeting,
and he now stands on their minutes as an offender.
William Forster and J. J. Gurney were with the committee when this was done.
It would seem as if there is sufficient strength in Hardshaw East to effect his disownment,
and it is said J. J. G. was very pointed and decided in his expressions
in support of the order and doctrines of the Society,
when attending that Monthly Meeting with the Yearly Meeting`'s Committee;
but he must do something as E. Bates is doing before I can
have full confidence in his pretensions to soundness;
that is, he must unwrite some things which he has written;
and I have not failed to apprise Thomas Thompson
that such are my ideas respecting J. J. G.,
though I apprehend he is alarmed,
and finds that he has let down so many bars that things
have run to much greater length than he was aware.
But the fact is that the present state of things in England
is the legitimate fruit of many of his publications.

I attended the last Quarterly Meeting at New Bedford; it was, on the whole,
a pretty good time,
and I was favored to be a little more faithful than I was
in a Select Meeting thou and I sat in there together;
in short, some general and a good deal of individual labor fell to my lot,
which I thought it my place to extend, as one of the committee from the Select Meeting,
for the purpose.
On the whole I thought the brethren there were disposed to do very near right;
but some were far from being apprised of the length things had run in England,
and of the danger of their running in this country.

Friends there seemed glad to see me,
and I did not feel that I had left any bad savor behind me.
In the public meeting Mary Battey was highly favored,
and my spirit rejoiced in her exercises.
Lindley M. Hoag was there, and some part of his testimony was good;
but one part of it caused me some doubt and suffering,
for in the first part of it he clearly made the Scriptures to be the only means of salvation,
though in the latter part he handled spirituality so well
that it was covered with what might be called a good plaster;
but the first ought not to have been.
I had not a chance to speak to him on the subject, which I regret.

In the last meeting there was not much business of note,
but I was glad to find thy visit with Benjamin Buffinton
was spoken of in the accounts in very acceptable terms,
particularly the Monthly Meetings of Nantucket and Sandwich,
and verbal accounts from another or two,
but it is not now in my recollection whether returning minutes were made.
On the whole, it was a pretty good Quarterly Meeting, and I was glad I was there.
Thomas and Lydia Ann Gould were there also.

Thou hast or will hear of the decease of D. Brayton and John Buffinton,
before this reaches thee.
I have this morning seen Thomas and Henry Gould, at their mills;
they were both well and the family also.
Father and Mother Rodman and Friends generally are in usual health.
If thou hast any further intelligence from England do let me have it.
My last date was 10th mo., 8th, 1836.
I should be glad to be remembered to thy sister, the widow of Abel Collins,
and her family.
My wife unites in love to thee and thine, and I remain

Dartmouth, 1st mo., 1st, 1837.

[.salutation]
Dear Friend,

Some little time has elapsed since the reception of thy
kind and affectionate letter which was very acceptable.
It is always cordial to hear from and to know we
are had in remembrance of those whom we love,
in the Truth, and for the Truth`'s sake, and perhaps the more so to me at this time,
as I have now been confined for a number of weeks to the house, and mostly to my room,
thus deprived of seeing many friends; at these seasons,
such testimonials of gospel affection are indeed precious.

M+++.+++ and B. Purinton, in the course of their visit this way,
called and tarried a night with us.
I was glad to see them; they seemed to be quite encouraged respecting some individuals,
in and about Providence, of whom we have had the greatest fears.
I hope they may not be deceived.
No doubt thou heard that L. M. H., attended our Quarterly Meeting,
and expected to visit in yours.
I hope he may not receive harm.
But O! the dangers that await us on every hand!
What need--what great need of a strict attention
to the sacred injunction of our blessed Lord:
"`What I say unto you I say unto all, watch.`"

Ah, herein alone is our safety--a continual watching, even unto prayer,
lest we enter into temptation--that thus we may be preserved
from the snares and baits of the subtle twining serpent,
who I believe never was more busy;
and of a truth his insinuations are but too successful, with the unwatchful and unwary;
for with his tail he hath drawn down (hath he not?) stars of the first magnitude.
Such, I have been ready to fear,
were not satisfied with moving in that orbit which infinite wisdom allotted them,
but aspiring to rise still higher, how have they fallen far below; yea,
how are the mighty fallen, and become as wandering stars,
having no sure abiding place on the immutable Rock,
but are left to wander on the barren mountains and desolate hills,
where there is neither rain nor dew,
nor fields of offering--unhappy mortals! whose situation
is greatly to be lamented and deplored.
But they have made their own choice,
and we must leave them to partake of the fruit of their own procuring.

I notice thy remarks on a state of poverty with which I cordially unite,
having long since been satisfied that great is the advantage resulting therefrom,
to us poor frail finite creatures;
and that it is in infinite wisdom and mercy that those seasons
of stripping and reduction are meeted out to us.
Thou knowest as well as I, my dear friend,
how much better it is to be of the number of the poor in spirit,
than of the proud in heart--seeing the Lord is nigh unto the poor and needy,
that are ready to faint by the way, who have no strength to rely on,
but his eternal arm--to these he giveth power, and supplyeth them with his own strength.
I have often said in the secret of my heart,
(I humbly trust from a living sense of the abundant mercy of our Heavenly Father,
in thus wisely dealing with us,) O! Lord, keep me always poor and begging,
even sensible of my own frailty and weakness,
keep me watchful and dependent on thee for every blessing,
and here may we always be found,
because we do know that this keeps us near the Fountain of divine life,
in whom are all our fresh springs.

I have often recurred to thy late visit amongst us with satisfaction;
for it rarely happens (I think thou wilt admit) in these days,
that we can meet with those with whom we can commune and interchange our views and ideas
on subjects which ought greatly to interest the rightly concerned in our Society,
without a feeling which obstructs our open and free intercourse.
But I believe thou wert sensible that a goodly number hereaway
were prepared to hail thee as a servant of the Lord,
aiming to keep his covenant,
even the new covenant of the everlasting gospel of
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ--and who could,
and some of whom did secretly bid thee God speed--so that however
there may be seasons in which thou mayst feel poor and empty,
be encouraged to hold thyself in all readiness,
that when the command goes forth to lift up thy voice as a trumpet,
to declare unto Jacob his transgressions and to Israel his sins,
prompt obedience may be thine; remembering as a stimulus that "`he that watereth,
shall himself be watered.`"

Sad and deplorable as is the state of things and
of individuals in England and on this continent,
it is nevertheless interesting to know how they progress;
and for thy kindness in furnishing now and then some little account,
we feel much obliged.
I hope thou wilt continue to favor us with such information as thou mayest deem prudent.
What those Friends who have endeavored to hold up the hands of E. Bates will now say,
or can say, respecting his soundness in the principles of friends,
I know not--will they still plead for Baal, or will they return and look unto Abraham,
our father, and to the hole of the pit whence they were digged?

I hope thou wilt often think upon and remember me when it is well
with thee--my situation is one that is conducive to low times--but
I endeavor to keep near to Him who is my sure comforter,
and as much as in me lies to wear a cheerful countenance;
but there is much to depress and to weigh down the spirit;
added to this is my extreme weakness of body,
which at times seems as much as I can well bear--yet after all,
there are seasons in which I feel raised above all these things.
O! when the smallest token is given of divine regard,
and a little evidence is felt that underneath is the everlasting Arm; yea,
to know that my Redeemer lives, it is enough, I ask for nothing more.

Oh, my dear friend, I am not boasting;
for truly and feelingly I know that unto me belongeth shame, blushing,
and confusion of face.
But unto the blessed author and finisher of our faith, be forever ascribed all praise,
might, majesty, and power,
who hath loved us and washed us in his own most precious blood!
With desires for our mutual preservation out of all the dangers
and snares that may await us through this vale of tears,
sorrow, and temptation, I conclude in much love to thee and thy dear wife,
in which my dear husband unites, and remain,

My Dear Friend,

Although much time is not allotted me at present to make returns for thy late favor,
yet I feel bound, in a few words,
to acknowledge the satisfaction which I felt in reading
and re-reading thy salutary and truly instructive letter,
and can say, that I believe I comprehend every part of it,
and trust it is one of those experimental and lively epistles
by which I have been so often instructed and profited.
Some of thy remarks upon thy own experience, do remarkably answer to mine,
as face to face in a glass;
and herein confirmation and instruction has been vouchsafed
at a time when I had been almost ready to faint by the way,
having often felt as though I had never a friend in the world, nor yet above the world;
and it was under such feelings that thy very unexpected,
yet truly welcome letter arrived,
and brought with it a precious portion of sisterly feeling and sisterly fellowship,
with the assurance that I was not alone in daily
necessities and daily begging for a morsel of bread.

Well, my dear friend,
I desire to be bowed in humble thankfulness for every crumb of heavenly nourishment,
when a very little seems like a feast; for so it is when there is a famine in the land.
And oh!
I am ready to fear that I am not humble enough, and thankful enough, and watchful enough,
when favored with the riches of the Redeemer`'s love, in the service of Truth,
as well as the sweet society of brethren and sisters almost as dear as life itself.

I hope to be favored, if consistent with the Divine will, to moderate my joy,
as well as my sorrow,
as it is probable that wisdom would lead to a more even
temperament of mind than I have yet been favored to attain;
however,
I hope never to be insensible to the abundant and unmerited mercy of God our Saviour,
nor yet to the tender sympathy and fellowship of my dear friends,
for these I count to be all that makes it life to live,--because faithful obedience
is certainly included as a requisite in such experience and favor.

I feel entirely safe, my dear and valued friend, in thus freely opening my mind to thee,
knowing well to whom I am writing, and trusting,
that in the freedom and fellowship of that gospel which
we have both been desiring and endeavoring to promote,
that thou wilt feel thyself entirely at liberty to unfold
thy views in relation to thy own religious experience,
as well as to give counsel to a brother,
who knows that his own safety much depends upon watching unto prayer,
and in having a place in his own mind for the counsel of dear friends.
The purposes of social order are great and exceedingly interesting.
Oh! how imperious the necessity to sit low with the brethren,
and not to seek for great things; for he that desireth to be above his brethren,
is sure to fall into a snare.

Very affectionately thy friend,

Extract from a letter from Sarah +++[+++Lynes]
Grubb to Ann Coning, transmitted by the latter to John Wilbur, dated 24th of 6th mo.,
1837.

[.embedded-content-document.letter]
--

I fully concur in the belief mentioned by dear John Wilbur,
as being that of some valuable Friends in America,
that the disaffection in this country grew out of
the unsound writings of the Friend in question,
and, I would add, the unsound preaching, the much speaking on the knees,
and the great lecturing, as well as more private engagements.
It is well understood, that J. J. Gurney had little doubt,
that by entreaty in his own way,
he could prevail upon the Beaconites to remain with Friends as members,
but finding his efforts fail, and not being satisfied to go all the way with them,
he chose openly to dissent from them,
and bear all the aspersions thrown on him from that quarter,
which seems to have procured him the warm approval of those
who last year could not have evinced the same feeling.

I confess, that nothing short of an acknowledgment of error,
and deep sorrow for the past, though done with good intention,
appears to me to be sufficient to satisfy my tried mind,
with respect to one so influential,
and whose sentiments on things of great importance to us as a body,
are published to the nations.
The ministry of this Friend of late, is much approved by most, as perfectly orthodox,
but are his views really changed?
I doubt it; and if they are,
would it not seem likely to be right to wait a little in deep abasedness,
until it could be known that such is the case?

What occasions me the most sorrow, is that in this day of sifting as from sieve to sieve,
we have, in a Society capacity, retarded the great work,
and owned much which the great Lord of the heritage has appointed to be winnowed away.
O, the consideration hereof weighs down my spirit,
and because there appears at present no remedy, my soul weeps in secret places,
and I go mourning all the day long; yet there is at times a humble, but sure hope,
that there will be a discerning more clearly between thing and thing,
between the covering which is not of God`'s spirit,
and that which he prepares and grants to those who are truly watchful.

Not knowing how far it might be best to communicate any part of thy letter,
or the extract from J. W.`'s, I left it at home, but may mention,
that Ann Jones was a good deal troubled about the American concern,
to which she spoke in the Meeting for Ministers and Elders,
and would have been glad if it had been given up for the present.
Most likely thou hast written to John Wilbur.
How exactly he and ourselves see eye to eye!
Well, it is a comfort that some are prepared to do so.

[.salutation]
My Dear And Valued Friend,

Thy last valuable communication, dated 3rd mo., was forwarded to me at Dublin,
whither I had gone to attend the Yearly Meeting;
it was truly strengthening and confirming to me, and how sweet to be permitted to feel,
that though the mighty ocean swells and foams between us,
yet that it cannot hinder the feeling of a sweet unity,
and the flowing of a precious love to and fro between
kindred spirits on your shores and ours.
Oh! it is indeed a favor I feel unworthy to partake of, though I dare not disallow it,
and desire to be preserved from forfeiting!

The subject of a part of thy letter was very remarkable to me, as thou wast ignorant,
outwardly,
of how we were likely to be tried this Yearly Meeting by
the laying before us of J. J. G.`'s concern to visit America.
Oh! it was indeed a painful meeting; I never sat the like!
Oh! my dear friend, there are too many superficial ones amongst us,
that look too much on outward show and appearance, and so are deceived.
Most of our principal Friends (in the true weight and deepness of judgment),
such as S. Grubb, G. and A. Jones, Jacob Green, William Gundry, and others,
spoke against his being liberated at this time, S. G. very strikingly,
and my heart fully united with it;
she reminded us of the restraining as well as constraining influences of the Spirit,
instancing in the Apostles`' days what is recorded in the Acts,
and said that she believed in the present case "`the Spirit suffered it
not,`" that our dear friend wanted further purification from the mixture,
etc.

There were a number more of the diffident ones, who, I believe,
were entirely of this mind, but held their peace.
But it was all overruled by such as were connected or partial,
also such as (I trust it is not improper for me to say)
are blinded by his adopting and preaching ancient views.
Some spoke in an awfully painful way,
attributing dear S. G.`'s view to the serpentine
wisdom and the understanding of the prudent,
and one returned thanks at the conclusion that it
had been confounded and brought to nought!
Ah! my dear friend, many of us are greatly pained by his liberation;
we feel it is a sanction of his books and lectures, as well as ministry and conduct,
and to the injury of the precious cause.

I fully unite with what thou says of his books.
I have been watching the rise and spreading of these views these ten years past,
and have felt inwardly clothed with sackcloth because thereof.
But much as I deplore the holding back of many cautious ones in the above meeting,
I am inclined to hope with my brother John that it will be overruled for
good by Him who can do mighty things for his poor oppressed ones,
and make a way of relief where they can see none.
John seems to be surprised or dismayed at no evil things amongst us,
but marks with calmness and confiding hope the gradual development of the man of sin.

To return to J. J. G.--I hope you will be strengthened
to be faithful to your feelings towards him,
for the honor of the cause and for our help here!
Oh! is it not the case that the cunning and cruel adversary
finds that Beaconism will no longer serve his turn now,
so he sets up another image, still more beautiful, and paints it to the very life,
and calls all to fall down and worship it, to the sound of outward sweetness and harmony?
Oh! that the weak little ones may be enabled to see
the lifeless image through all the paint,
that we may shut our ears against the melody,
and may be strengthened to stand firm to our God,
however the furnace of affliction may be heated as it were sevenfold!

It is very striking to me that a number of the younger
sort see through all these beautiful things;
they can taste where there is life or where it is a picture;
whereas most of those we look on as fathers and mothers cannot;
they salve all over with love and not judging.
I expect it is to humble us and prove us still more, that we may lean on none,
and that many more of such will fall away, so that the remnant will be small,
that a child may number them.
One seems to long for the good meetings again as in ancient days;
and when we are thoroughly purified and reduced, I can but think with dear S. Grubb,
that there will be a flocking to us as doves to the windows,
to the name of the Lord which shall be written upon us,
and for the enjoyment of his presence, which shall be in us and with us.

Edward Ash`'s book appears to some of us a specious and unsound thing,
professing to stand up for our ancient Friends, but really lessening them.
My brother Hawlinson has opposed its large second edition in the Meeting for Sufferings,
and, in consequence, had an interview with E. A. upon it; but it was a very painful time,
only showing more clearly his unsoundness.
The Morning Meeting approved of the first edition.
"`Well, dear friend,
do breathe for the help of the poor little panting ones as thou art enabled; and I shall,
I know, think and feel greatly for you across the ocean, under coming circumstances.

Wilt thou write to me a little on this subject, if thou art free,
without waiting a whole year?
My mind felt much with thee just about the time thou wast writing to me.
Thou had a clear sense of what is passing here,
but oh! how it would pain thee to see to the full!
The Lord help the poor weak children,
preserve them patient in suffering and in deep humility before him, saith my soul!
And Oh! that we may be strengthened to be faithful to him,
for truly it is a most dismaying time!

Farewell, very affectionately.

From thy truly sympathizing and nearly united friend,

[.salutation]
My Dear Children,

Having been repeatedly admonished and instructed in regard to the
uncertainty of the very best of our earthly possessions and enjoyments;
and how subject we are to be separated one from another for time;
one thing have I greatly desired, and do still crave, for our little band,
even for every one of those who call us "`father`" and "`mother,`" including, too,
both father and mother, that such may be our condition,
in the relation in which we stand with the Father of Spirits,
that however we may be separated in time, and some leave before others, nevertheless,
that the whole little company may again be joyfully collected,
though it may be one by one, and united in a state unchangeable and full of glory,
when death shall be swallowed up in victory,
and shall never be able to break our ranks again.

How unspeakably excellent, then,
that we be all fully reconciled to Him who rules
and reigns in the kingdom of his own glory,
and to all his ways and providences.
However nearly we may be connected with,
and possessed of a part not durable or redeemable, but perishable;
let us look through the veil of these fleshly tabernacles,
and regard that which perisheth not, but which is eternal,
and the paramount object of all that has been done through the covenant of a Redeemer.
May the whole of that covenant, then, my dear children, be availed of,
both by us and by you, in all which it has done for us without us,
and is proffering to us and doing for us within us,
through an unshaken faith in his power, and the rewards of obedience.

But how shall I, my dear children,
submit to give you the information (if not received before)
of the severe sickness and removal from us of our dear Lydia!
Precious child! her Heavenly Parent has seen meet to take her from her earthly parents,
and, as we trust, to himself and into his own kingdom;
from her brothers and sisters here, to his family in heaven;
and but for the ties and tenderness of nature, though unspeakable our loss,
we could not weep.
Her breathing was very laborious for the last ten or twelve hours,
but her mind and recollection were strong and unimpaired to the last.

She exhibited precious evidence of her readiness and preparation for the event,
having been impressed from the first that her time was come.
She was full of love, and sent a message of it to all her absent brothers and sisters,
and to everybody--said she was ready to go--took solemn leave of every one present by
the salutation of a kiss--and exhorted the children present to greater faithfulness.
She finally passed away as one falling into a sweet sleep, without the least struggle;
for, truly, it did appear that death had lost its sting, and had no terrors for her.

Hopkinton, 8th mo., 1837.

[.salutation]
My Dear Daughter,

Thy letter, forwarded by, was truly interesting and comfortable to us,
both in relation to thy late dear sister, and your own trials and consolations,
and I did rejoice in the peace and comfort which
resulted from the testimony of our friend;
and, as in your tribulations, so in your joys,
I think I am prepared to take a part with you,
and since +++_______+++`'s arrival I have feared that an excess
of trouble has contributed to thy present sickness,
my precious child,
and a living desire arises that all may work together for good to thee,
and trust that it will prove so, as I know thou lovest the Lord Jesus Christ,
and may therefore safely and confidently commit thyself
unreservedly to his tender care and holy keeping;
for though he suffers us to pass through great tribulations,
yet the mark for the prize of our high calling of God in Christ Jesus,
is the keeping of the word of his patience, in faith and resignation to all,
and so become the happy and distinguished receivers of his gracious promises,
unfailing to those who willingly wade through great tribulations;
whereby their robes are washed and made white in the blood
of the Lamb--the life and power of the Lamb.

Such, my dear child, is the chief of all my desires, both for parents and children;
and at this time is my sympathy and tender love more
especially awakened and drawn out towards thee,
with breathing desires and prayers that the God of all our sure mercies will be pleased,
in the abounding thereof, to replenish thy heart with his love and goodness,
with his blessed presence, which is life and peace,
and never fails to make hard things easy and bitter things sweet;
and I believe he will sanctify all and crown all of thy afflictions,
and make them productive of an exceeding and eternal weight of glory.
In that which never fails, my dear child, I am thine,

From John Barclay to J. W.

[.signed-section-context-open]
Hastings, in Sussex, 8th mo., 1837.

[.salutation]
My Very Near, Though Far Distant Friend, John Wilbur,

Thou hast been often, yea, very often, brought into sweet and precious remembrance;
and great closeness of fellowship in that which never fades nor grows
cold has been felt both by my beloved wife and myself towards thee,
whenever we have thought of thee, although we have been wanting in the expression of it.
Indeed, were we, or were I, to express by letter all I feel towards my dear friends,
I need have little else to do;
and if thou wast to address or be addressed by all in this
land who love and esteem thee as highly as they do and ought,
there would be a large field of correspondence opened and to be kept up.

But with regard to letter writing, before I proceed further,
I must say that I feel indebted to thee for thy valued communication,
now of so long date back as the 7th mo., 1835,
and for thy frequent messages of love and remembrance to my dear wife and self,
through different channels, especially in one letter addressed to my sister Lydia,
of which I have made a copy, and have it by me.
And indeed, my beloved friend, allow me to say, without any,
the farthest wish to flatter, thy letters are not for thyself alone,
or for those thou writest to;
it is my belief they (or else some other record of thy sentiments on the state
and prospects of the Church of Christ) are designed for the instruction,
consolation, and warning of thy successors.

This is my deliberate judgment, and I deliberately mention it;
and that I desire thou mayest see it thy duty to
make such memoranda or arrangement in thy lifetime,
that thy correspondents may be known and applied to.
To some diffident minds, I know, anything of this sort may be painful,
and what they would shrink from; and to some weak minds such hints might be injurious;
but I trust thou knowest well where all thy fresh springs of wisdom and utterance lie,
and in whom the prerogative is,
to open or to shut;--so much the more blamable or responsible, in my opinion,
is such an one, if he wrap his Lord`'s talent comparatively in a napkin,
and put his light under a bushel.

I may tell thee, I have in past years even kept a memorandum of letters sent,
when I could not well keep a copy.
Now, I have relieved my mind in the above respect,
how shall I do to set forth all I could say on our present, past,
and probable future position, as a religious body, in this land?
I trust, on many points,
thou art ably and fully addressed by many Friends of this country.
I shall then only touch at things that come before me,
and thou must give me credit for entire union with thee,
and all those who still remain wholly on the Lord`'s side,
and one with our ancient Friends and valiants, even the primitive stock,
who came forth in the powerful Name which is above every name, and unto which,
every other name, however high and lifted up, must bow.

Oh! beloved friend,
thou that saw the first seeds and dawning of that
which has now manifested itself in degree,
knowest well enough how much of the same nature and root we still have,
to oppress and afflict us, and of which it is difficult to particularize,
or speak closely, in the abstract, without allusions to individuals who give uneasiness.
The author of "`Truth Vindicated,`" Henry Martin, has,
by that book and the others he has since written, done what I consider to be,
in some respects, a similar service to that of thyself in thy published letters;
he has opened up the radical causes of distinction
between the early and the modern Friends,
and their opponents.

I hope thou hast seen all his publications, especially the recent ones,
continued in Letters No. 1 and No. 2, and a third is soon expected,
which is to contain strictures on J. J. G.`'s
"`Brief Remarks on Impartiality in the Interpretation of Scripture,`" etc.,
in which J. J. G. takes the modern and usual professor-like view of many texts,
which may be called Quaker texts,
and which we have appreciated and made use of differently from others.
The pamphlet of J. J. G.`'s in MS. was examined by our poor Morning Meeting,
and declined to be passed;
it was at that time appended to J. J. G.`'s lamentable
"`Strictures on Truth Vindicated.`"

He then privately published it, as we may say, that is,
printed it for private circulation, not for sale; and, in consequence,
it was the more rare and sought for, and MS. copies were taken.
I was not in the Morning Meeting when it was examined, nor did I glance at it,
till a copy was forwarded anonymously to George Jones,
while he and his wife were under our roof at Yearly Meeting time this year.
They and many sound Friends were made very uneasy with it at that time;
and I do trust some did their duty towards the writer,
but I should fear with but little effect, as in other instances.

Thus much I thought fit to tell thee, and thou mayest doubtless obtain a copy of it,
by applying to thy correspondent, G. Crosfield.
I conclude the author to be now on your side the great water,
and therefore hope he may be more wisely dealt with than he has been here.
Have you no Priscillas and Aquillas, to take him unto them, and expound matters?
I openly expressed my desire this might be the case,
and that he might be a good Apollos is my prayer for him, if it be possible,
and may mightily convince and convert to the good old way,
instead of subverting it and those that are in it!

Samuel Rundell`'s pamphlet, which treats on Redemption, Worship, the Supper, etc.,
was published, I think, two years ago; and, before he republished it,
he wished to submit it to the Morning Meeting, and put it under my care; which,
through want of health and time, I handed over to my dear brother A. R. Barclay,
with the author`'s approbation;--it was read in the meeting,
and some matters in it were left to two or three Friends to confer with S. R. about;
it has now been a year, perhaps a year and a half, under care,
and the Friends cannot agree with S. R. in regard to it;
he believing his views are sound and scriptural,
and according to those of our early Friends.

The objecting Friends are Josiah Forster and Geo.
Stacey.
How they will hobble over their difficulty, I know not.
They took the sentiment of Susanna Corder about it, who was of their mind; while,
on the other hand, S. R. wished John Allen, his neighbor of Liskeard, to meet Joel Lean,
Gowen Ball, and myself upon it We did, and thought S. R. was right, and Josiah wrong.
One point is, "`the eating the flesh,`" etc., which we say is spiritual,
but they say otherwise, and yet manage to steer clear of the Papists, as they think.
We may hope this film will be removed; but there are other obstacles,
and I understand that J. J. G. objected, in the Morning Meeting,
to the whole scope and tendency of the tract, as partaking of mysticism, etc.

Edward Ash`'s Address to Friends has given some of us much uneasiness in parts;
as letting down the standard of the early Friends, as well as in other respects.
So do some other pieces, professedly written to defend the Truth:
they will not go the whole length with the early Friends.
Indeed, they differ not merely from the very oldest and first books,
but from those deliberately sanctioned by the Church from the first, as standard works,
down to these times.
Very numerous and various are the proofs and illustrations of this innovating,
libertine spirit, that cannot brook the cross to their false wisdom and crude notions,
sucked in from mixed authors of other persuasions.

I have written some few plain, full letters, within the last two years or more,
to Thomas Evans of Philadelphia,
opening my mind as to the tendencies of our day in this land, and, in one of them,
begged he would send or show thee--as one deeply
interested in our state--what I had written,
if he had opportunity, and excusing myself from writing to thee;
but his replies are loose, general, and indefinite,
not responding to the pith and marrow of mine, nor alluding to thee at all,
but only as to general degeneracy and a worldly spirit, etc.
So that I have felt much of a stop in my mind to close communication
with him on the gist of the controversy that troubles us.
He once spoke of H. Martin`'s Deism, and I replied to that, strongly.
And though I have letters of his father to Thomas Shillitoe,
complaining of J. J. G.`'s unsoundness,
yet I fear the son may be inclining to look on the hopeful, charitable,
or condescending side, or rather to overlook the main grounds of dissatisfaction.

How remarkably appropriate and well-timed were thy letters to my dear sister Lydia,
dated 4th mo., 1836, and 3rd mo., 1837, copies of which I have by me at this place,
where I am staying with my dear Mary and family, for the confirmation of my health.
These letters we both thought fit to show to divers Friends,
who with us do fully unite with thee.
Also thine to myself, in 1835, is entirely what I could have myself written or signed.
Dear Thomas Shillitoe`'s Journal was consigned to me for publication,
some time before his death.
I undertook it because it seemed as if he could trust but few if any;
but it is a great job, and, in my feeble state, Friends must still have patience with me,
for it is not yet gone to press.

My line is more in reviving the ancient writings of early Friends.
Thou hast doubtless seen Dewsbury`'s Life;
I am now nearly ready with Joseph Pike`'s Journal, an elder of Cork,
who was contemporary with W. Edmundson,--also Joseph Oxley`'s Journal,
who travelled to your land about 1770.
I intend producing, if my life be spared and ability extended,
"`Letters of early Friends,`" having had access to large collections; it will develop,
in plain, strong colors, the standing and movements of our worthy predecessors,
and what spirit they were of.

So that, though often laid by, and much prevented from travelling or exposure,
and also feeling the spring of gospel ministry much shut up,
and great oppression and obstruction in meetings,
especially where there has been a deal of living on words; my task little by little,
as I am able, seems to be,
to hold up to view what the power of Divine Life has made those who have gone before us,
and have received the end of their faith; and whose faith we are bound to follow,
and to consider the end of their conversation; Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today,
and forever.

In this work I am often encouraged,
not only by the rallying effects visible especially among the faithful,
the tender and young, and not only so, but among the convinced,
and also those true sheep that are not of our fold.
Many there are, who have retired from all other persuasions and systems,
and walk much alone in religion, and these often say,
Friends are not what they once were; that they unite with G. Fox, Barclay, etc.,
but not with modern Friends.
Many hidden, precious, seeking characters there are, scattered up and down;
so that I have been ready to think the messengers
will have to go more into the highways and hedges,
and ask who is worthy, and gather them to their Teacher,
and to sit down under his teaching, and follow their inward convictions,
without reference to any gathered people,
till they come to see there is a remnant--a poor and afflicted remnant, already gathered;
and then they may be in time prepared to flock as doves to the windows.

It is my full belief,
that all the outcry against Friends will be overruled for the good of the Church,
and spread of the gospel principles we profess;
and I long that all who cannot see with us would honestly go their ways from us,
and we should be the stronger, purer people, and take more root downward, etc.
But it is a disingenuous, dark, unworthy spirit that possesses them, and they seek,
by remaining among us, gradually to unhinge and weaken us, and, if possible,
to refine and divest us of what is intrinsic and indispensable.

The best among other persuasions sympathize with us;
they like the old-fashioned cut of Quakerism,
and wish us to be faithful to our principles;
but it is the mass of high-professing people, that are riveted to their sect and system,
who rejoice in our divisions, and hope to gain some from us.
Our state about London is still lamentably weak and low, sickly and decrepid;
none scarcely coming forward in a bold, undeviating way,
but crouching and cringing often; yet I think some little ones begin to show themselves,
and lift up their heads; and some who stood high and bear rule, and have erred in vision,
and whose feet had well-nigh slipped,
the dragon having nearly swept them down with those who have fallen,
are somewhat humbled; at least I hope so;
but not sufficiently--not so as candidly to acknowledge their mistaken tendencies;
yet they are restrained, and draw in their horns somewhat.

As to the country districts, there is, by what I learn or know, a goodly company,
in the North especially, and here and there elsewhere,
who more and more see through not only Beaconism but Gurneyism; and desire,
however weakly, to contend for the faith once and still delivered, and to keep the faith,
and hold fast what they have, and reach forth to what is pure and most excellent.
We are a mixed company, who must be sifted yet further; indeed,
the disaffection is working its way, but morbidly.

My knee is much in the same state, no appearance of active disease;
but I am still on crutches, and quite reconciled to it,
and thankful to be so comparatively hearty and well generally,
though delicate and feeble.
Our very dear love to thee, thy family circle all, as if they were named,
and all who are dear to thee and joined to the Lord, and so of one spirit;
we salute all such who can receive our salutation, desiring all mercy, peace, strength,
and salvation to be poured out upon them as on ourselves, now and evermore.
Fare thee well,
beloved friend! and may the Lord Jesus stand by thee in all thy exercises,
and bring thee through them, to his own praise and thy rejoicing.

[.signed-section-context-open]
Philadelphia, 9th mo., 11th, 1837.

[.salutation]
Dear Friend, John Wilbur,

I received thy letter, and am glad to find that there are some yet left,
who are not carried away by the stream of popularity and fashionable opinions,
which now seems threatening to overwhelm our poor, tried, religious Society.
Oh, the want of weight and depth which is strikingly evident in our meetings,
both for worship and discipline.
When met to transact the affairs of the Church,
what a cringing and crouching to those noted for much worldly wisdom,
and abundance of the riches of this world; so that, indeed,
the pure influence of the Spirit is seldom sought after or expected;
// lint-disable no-undefined
it being considered only mysticism or, at best, but undefined imaginary sensations,
not safe to follow; and that which the Lord hath determined a death upon, is kept alive,
and made the chief agent in conducting the concerns of Society, which,
if rightly understood, is surely the Lord`'s business.

The conduct of the Yearly Meeting of Ministers and Elders in London,
is really very affecting.
This man, J. J. Gurney, because he has written much, is considered very learned,
highly polished, and an acute reasoner; and being very rich, and living in high style,
is greatly caressed, and esteemed as almost a prodigy among us.
I have perused a great deal of his writings,
and have been sorely distressed at the darkness and confusion
which is almost inseparable from their contents.

The Hebrew and Greek languages being very limited,
one word in them will sometimes embrace several significations,
some of which will be in entire contrast with others; this he has caught at,
and then made use of those opposite senses to vary the present translation of the Scriptures,
and to promote his purpose in undervaluing and contradicting
the solid sense and judgment of our ancient Friends,
that he may the more readily introduce and propagate Episcopalian doctrines.

He tries to make out that the eating of the flesh, and drinking the blood of Christ,
means a belief in his incarnation,
thus lowering down that deep experience and blessed
fellowship in spirit with the Lord Jesus,
in his baptisms and sufferings,
to a mere assent of the human mind--that the gospel which is preached in,
or to every human being, means the outward preaching of the gospel doctrines, that is,
the declaration of the atonement of Christ;
that the name of Jesus does not signify his power,
but only to ask of the Father that he would grant our petitions,
merely because of his beloved Son, Jesus Christ;
that therefore we are not to look for the immediate
influence of the Spirit as a qualification to pray,
but to push forward into this offering whenever we incline to it;
and many other changes he makes which I can call by no other name than perversions.

He endeavors to make out that our primitive Friends were under mistaken views;
in order that he may, with more facility,
lay waste our attachment to the doctrines and testimonies they held,
and prepare us to embrace new schemes which will
be more acceptable to the unregenerate man;
liberate us from the mortifying operation of the cross of Christ, and cause us,
as a Society, to be more respected by the carnal,
superficial professors of religion in the several denominations.

Early after his arrival, the elders in this city being called together,
he mentioned that he had a prospect of a general public meeting for third day evening,
which several of the elders were disposed to allow of; this I could not feel easy with,
and made my objection in his presence; but next morning,
as he limited his design to the members only, they acceded to it.
Having so fully expressed my disapprobation of a meeting,
in the before-mentioned interview, I did not attend their second meeting,
nor the public meeting.

There appears to be many who will doubtless be caught with his politeness,
his affability, and his seeming accordance with our religious tenets;
but before he can be received as a minister in unity,
he ought to condemn the sentiments and doctrines contained in his writings,
and give indubitable evidence of humbling submission and sincere
abiding under the purifying baptism of the Holy Ghost,
and fire, which would indeed make him humble, simple,
and perhaps give him to see that he has never yet been so stripped of his own righteousness,
as to be called to, and qualified for the work of the ministry.

declaring J. J. G. to be no Quaker, etc., which is omitted.]

[.embedded-content-document.letter]

I hope Friends in New England will be on their guard against,
and not be taken by plausible outward appearance, or the flourish of oratory,
but endeavor to keep to the inward sense and feeling
which the Holy Head of the Church will,
no doubt, graciously grant to his sincere humble followers,
even under the depth of close trial and besetment.
There are a few here, who, as they cannot unite with his sentiments and doctrines,
are narrowly watched, and thus they find it necessary to be very cautious;
hoping that it may please the Lord, not only to preserve them in faithfulness, but that,
in due time,
he may make it manifest that the cause and testimony of Truth has been their only aim,
and the fervent desire of their souls.

As J. J. G. was almost continually surrounded with company of various kinds,
and but a very few days in the city,
I believe that no private opportunity was taken with him.
Although some of his advocates endeavor to make out that his intended
visit was almost unanimously approved in the meeting which liberated him,
yet the published account states that the numbers on each side were nearly balanced.

From Margaret Crosfield to J. W.

[.salutation]
Dear Friend,

[.signed-section-context-open]
Liverpool, 2nd mo., 23rd, 1888.

I can never forget thy acceptable labors and company amongst us;
thou came in a critical time,
and wast the means of preserving my husband and me from swerving from the Truth;
we saw not the danger until thou came, but I fear through sophistry and delusion,
and undue confidence in some,
we should have slidden off and been now like some once of high standing,
who are now wandering from mountain to hill, unsettled from waiting on the true Teacher,
and seeking water from broken cisterns;
anxiety and unhappiness depicted so legibly on some of their
visages as to be apparent to all who see them.
Since thou wast here,
what a sea of troubles have some of us passed through! and in degree do yet;
but thou knowest what a bitter separating spirit can produce where it gets in;
its arrows have been directed against thee, even in this land, in this house,
and in my presence--a poor return for thy labor of
love in coming as a gospel messenger amongst us.

Poor Isaac and Anna!
They were high then and bitter, and are so still;
attempting to carry the same appearance, but they are fallen stars;
and the iron must often have entered their souls, seeing their children scattered,
their two most beloved and eldest gone to the Episcopal Church,
and two more wandering here and there;
their nearest connections denying women`'s ministry,
a cut more to the quick to Anna than all the rest.

My dear husband was not at our last Yearly Meeting.
I was; and as far as I am capable of judging,
the Friends influential in our men`'s meeting for discipline,
if they are to be judged by their doings, are not of the sentiments taught by George Fox,
and embodied in the apology of Robert Barclay.
Many, especially among the women are faithful in the principles believed in by early Friends,
but they cannot make head against the others;
this was evident in the sittings of the Select Yearly Meeting, had it not been so,
Joseph John Gurney`'s visit would have been delayed, if not set aside.

The Friends who did not approve of it were faithful and very plain with him,
which he bore very well, but it was of no avail;
his numerous influential relations and private friends carried him through.
That his written works were the foundation of the present secession,
I undoubtedly believe.
Many that have left have declared they were the first
things that led them to these new views,
it was so declared publicly by several of them to the London Committee.

Dear John 1 have just read thine carefully over, and I do see clearly,
and unite in thy views respecting the writings of the Friend alluded to,
so does my husband; and we are the same we ever were; and according to our ability,
labor to uphold the Truth, and I cleared my mind in our last Select Yearly Meeting; but,
as I said before, the other current prevailed.
Josiah Forster came from his sick chamber to throw his weight into the scale,
and Elizabeth Dudley, though suffering under paralysis,
was led up between two Friends for a similar purpose.

Thou knowest the influence of the Forsters.
Dear Sarah Grubb did her best against it; but the truth is,
he has gone into your land with the unity of that part of
the Society who are influential in our Yearly Meeting.
I conceive thy query to be unanswerable;
his works on many points are not in unison with Fox and Barclay,
nor in my apprehension can ever be explained to mean anything
that sound Friends of primitive views can accord with;
they are many of them a burden to concerned Friends,
a sore burden to many in this land as well as yours;
and must remain so until he himself disavows the obnoxious passages,
and the speculative turn of them.
All I have not read.
I never profited by any I read, they are very superficial,
and have no unction accompanying;
it has always been incomprehensible to me that Friends who condemn Isaac Crewdson`'s
writings can unite with Joseph John`'s which in many parts they resemble.

Many injurious concessions were made to the Beaconites by way of conciliation,
which did no good.
At Isaac Braithwaite`'s request my husband was removed
from being assistant clerk to the Yearly Meeting,
and Samuel Gurney put in his place.
That made peace for a while;
but those things would not weld the iron and the clay together, they were not of us,
and it was better to let them go forth at once, as they have mostly done since,
rending as much as possible in their transit, like the evil spirits of old,
united in nothing that I know of but the abandonment of
seeking for Divine assistance in ministering and in worship,
being ready at all times,
some praying by a watch to measure half an hour set aside
for that purpose--but I will leave this sad theme.

I remain thy affectionate friend, and sister in the Truth.

[.signed-section-context-open]
Newport, 3rd mo., 30th, 1838.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

For myself, I have seen no cause to change my opinion of J. J. Gurney.
I continue to believe that he is as great an enemy to the Truth as ever he was,
and that the only reason why he tries to mix in a sound form of words sometimes,
is that he may allay the fears of Friends, and set their hearts at rest.
While they are in this state, he can say what he will, and such would not notice it.
I do not believe that he can frame to pronounce "`Shibboleth.`"
As for waiting to see him, so long as his books remain on his back,
I see no necessity for it.
They are sufficient evidence against him.
For it is impossible that such carnality as he has advocated in them,
should exist or remain, under the fire of that baptism,
with which the true believers are baptized by the "`one spirit into the one body;`"
and so come into the unity of "`the one faith,`" as it is in him who is Lord of all,
Head over all things to his church and people.

The longer I live, the more abundantly I am convinced that no part of that divine Truth,
which we were originally raised up a people to bear testimony to, can be dispensed with,
neither can it ever be changed.
For it is unchangeable in its nature,
like the unchangeable rock and foundation upon which it is based,--the
Rock of Ages--not of that age only in which our worthy forefathers
preached truth unto those to whom they were sent;
but it is as important to,
and as imperative and obligatory upon us of this
"`degenerate age,`" as it was in that age,
and will, I am satisfied, so continue to the latest period of the world.

And if we as a people should turn aside from that testimony to the light,
spirit and power of Christ, revealed in the heart,
as the primary rule and foundation of our faith and practice,
the whole building must and will fall.
There is no medium.
For as William Penn said: "`The light of Christ within,
as God`'s gift for man`'s salvation, is as the root of the goodly tree of doctrines,
which grew or branched forth out of it.`"
I quote from memory.

5th mo., 10th. It seems to me, my dear friend,
that if our precious testimonies are supported, it will be through suffering.
They that are born after the flesh,
always did and always will persecute them that are born after the Spirit.
Our worthy and honorable predecessors were Persecuted even unto death itself.
That may be the case again;
but it seems to me that it will more probably be of that kind,
spoken of by our blessed Lord: "`Suppose ye that I came to give peace on earth?
I tell you nay;
but rather division For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided,
three against two, and two against three; the father shall be divided against the son,
and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter,
and the daughter against the mother,`" etc.;
and "`the greatest enemies a man hath shall be they of his own household.`"

Is it not the case?
are not the greatest enemies to the Truth under the profession of it?
are they not the greatest persecutors of those that are concerned
and engaged for the support of Truth--for the law and the testimony?
Have they not more outward power than any others?
Are they not clothed with official authority,
with high and imposing titles and credentials?
Was it not so with E. Bates?
Did not he take his aim, and shoot his arrows, and hit the mark he aimed at,
while he was travelling under the outward sanction of the Society?
And is it not the case with this Englishman?

Will not those who bear testimony against him and his doctrines,
have to stand and contend for the faith, "`against principalities,
against powers,`" against spiritual wickedness in high places,
and even "`the abomination that maketh desolate, standing where it ought not to stand?`"
Really, it seems to me that the times upon which we have fallen are no common times,
and that the manner of this sifting differs from
any other that has hitherto come upon us.
For were we not raised up to bear testimony against all formality and will-worship?
Did not our predecessors support that testimony?
And not only so, did they not bear testimony to the true form,
and succeed in setting it up and establishing it?

When I look at these things,
when I consider the length and the breadth of the ground which our principles "`cover,
and compare it with our practice, my soul is humbled within me;
it is saddened and afflicted within me; and I am ready to say not only,
"`by whom shall the seed of Jacob arise,`" but, who shall be able to stand?
Nevertheless, I am well satisfied and convinced,
that the mark for the prize of this high and holy calling can in no wise
be attained but by and through the power and virtue of the seed,
Christ; although it does not appear to be a time, by any means,
in which it can be said that it "`reigns and is over
all,`" as it respects the state of the Church,
(however it may, in relation to its own essential almighty power,
or those who have "`gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, his mark,
and the number of his name,`" "`through the blood of the Lamb,
and the word of the testimony,`" which they have
held,) but that it is low and under great oppression.

I can scarcely think that thou wilt be inclined to censure me for too high a stamp,
although there is a great deal said now against such a stamp,
and everything must needs be subjected to these modern refiners`' melting pots,
and their unholy fire kindled thereunder, until it is neutralized,
if not entirely evaporated.
I greatly desire to see thee, and to be somewhat "`filled`" with thy company;
and I want to give thee an account of some things which it would
not be so easy nor so proper to put upon paper.

I will just add, that my having been with the burden-bearers there,
is a source of solid satisfaction to my mind;
and I am thankful in believing that the channel through which reproof and condemnation,
as well as peace and consolation, flow thereinto, is still mercifully kept open;
but I have not felt the former,
neither do I think it is truly "`evangelical`" to be found in the condition of "`miserable
sinners`" through life,--"`doing those things which we ought not to do,
and leaving undone those things which we ought to do,`"--any more than the apostle,
when he said:--"`There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus,
who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit.`"

Satisfied I am, that walking after or in the spirit, does not bring it,
any more than walking in the light brings darkness.
And whatever "`Christian love`" and fellowship or unity J. J. G. may speak and write of,
for those that are in Egyptian darkness with himself,
or desire them that are in the "`light`" to have for him,
I am abundantly convinced that there is but one kind
of unity or fellowship that is worth having,
and no other means of obtaining it, but by "`walking in the light.`"
This is the unity and the fellowship that I desire to feel,
and to be felt for me and with me; and I desire no other;
and they that are in the light can have no unity with the unfruitful works of darkness.

Thy friend, in the nearness of true Christian love,

From A. Rawlinson Barclay to J. W.

[.signed-section-context-open]
Leytonstone, near London, 18th of 5th mo., 1838.

Thus, my dear friend, I have to bear up as well as I may be enabled,
against the loss of a brother closely beloved in the Lord;
we were very near to each other in our views and
feelings as to the state of things amongst us,
and he was the cheerer and encourager of my heart under our late and present discouragements.
One is ready to cry out, who is there to fight the battles of the Lord in this gloomy day?
My dear friend, where we seem to be suffering most in the present time,
is in the feebleness and faithlessness of our London Morning Meeting.

This was what was so deeply upon dear John`'s mind;
and I think he looked to some effort being made in the Select Yearly Meeting, this time,
to strengthen the former meeting by representatives, from time to time,
of Friends from the country.
Thou knowest a little what sad pennings that meeting has passed,
in J. J. G.`'s reckless writings;
also E. Ash`'s sorry slurs on our ancient Friends`' writings; (which I was glad to see,
in my recent numbers of "`The Friend,`" had been touched upon,
and which I hope will meet the eye of some here.) Then they have
also rejected a new edition of dear Samuel Rundell`'s tract,
which came under my notice, the author having deputed me to attend to it;
I do not hesitate to say,
the reasons and views of the committee of the Morning
Meeting were inconsistent with our ancient principles,
and directly contrary to R B.`'s apology.

It is a small committee of this meeting to whom is
referred the close examination of MSS.+++;+++
and if they report to the meeting an opinion, one way or the other,
the meeting records it; and thus the business falls into a few hands.
On this occasion, in having to do with them, I did not hesitate to reprove them sharply,
for deserting the G. Whiteheads, the R. Barclays, the George Foxes, etc., of old times,
as the expositors of, or testimony-bearers unto our principles,
and taking to the J. J. Gurneys, etc., of modern times.
My dear brother also had to stand out nearly single-handed against these innovators,
some months ago.

I have recently published another little tract, of Extracts from early Friends,
on Baptism and the Supper,
in which I devoted a section to extracts intended to counteract
their new notions on the eating the flesh,
etc., (6th of John)--for which in part they rejected S. Rundell`'s tract;
they seem to consider that the flesh of Christ there spoken of,
means his outward body spiritually eaten, by faith, his outward sacrifice so partaken of,
believed in, etc., which is given for the life of the world;
and thus rejecting R. Barclay`'s view, that it refers to his spiritual body;
this spiritual view, it seems, savors too much of Hicksism for them.

I would forward thee my tract, but fear it would come heavy in postage.
Didst thou ever receive my last?
Thy last two letters to my dear brother came too late to be seen by him; I have them,
and shall take care of them.
We have heard little of J. J. G. of late;
I used to see many of his letters to his brothers or children;
but I now hear they are not shown about;
so I suppose he has been busily occupied in Philadelphia.
His last sheet on Scripture Interpretations is or has been sought up,
and I have not been able to get one.
It is a sad effusion, and I much fear has occasioned us much mischief,
and been the cause of some of the members of the committee of the
Morning Meeting adopting the views I have alluded to,
and thus has beguiled and beclouded them in their judgment of MSS.

This is a melancholy business for me to reflect upon,
to think that just before going away from us,
he should have printed and signed a document of that kind,
which has I believe occasioned, and continues so to do,
so much mischief and stumbling amongst those occupying upper ranks amongst us,
on whom devolves the very important duty of revising MSS.
on our faith, etc.
This matter, this sore, now lurks and prevails, I believe, among these select Friends;
but being on points of doctrine seldom touched upon in public,
does not get out much amongst us.

With respect to E. Ash`'s book, I took occasion, soon after I had read it,
to remark openly in our Meeting for Sufferings,
that I regretted to think that there were parts in that book which
I feared had escaped the proper care of the Morning Meeting,
and I resisted, in consequence, our printing, as was proposed,
a large edition of it for extensive circulation; this was a year ago;
I then (last Yearly Meeting) took an opportunity of speaking to the author,
stating my objections, and that I should still object, in our Meeting for Suffering,
to its being again printed in its then state; at the same time,
I felt that my controversy was necessarily against
the Morning Meeting for having passed it,
and thus shielding the author.

Far more came out of unsound views, in our conversation, than at all occurs in the book;
and I could see he was fully tinctured with J. J. G.`'s views on the flesh, etc.,
of Christ.
He stated,
that he had at home a large collection of objectionable passages from early Friends,
upon which he grounded his remarks in his second part.
I invited him to let me see them, as I was familiar with their controversial works,
and knew how largely they had replied to, or explained,
etc.;--but he has never sent them.
I was desired to confer with him,
that my objections might be attended to in the next edition; but I never did so,
as I could make nothing of such a piece of disjointedness.
I was afterwards called upon, as a member of the Meeting for Sufferings,
to explain what I had done, and why I objected to what had passed the Morning Meeting;
thus I was fairly brought out, and with my dear brother beside me,
we made out such a strong case against them (the very members, or some of them,
of the aforesaid committee of the Morning Meeting) that they were silenced,
and they thought it best to drop the matter.

It so happened, I had the hottest part of the engagement,
as I was deemed to be the prominent obstacle in the way.
I remember coming away from that sitting in admiration at the mercy and help of the Lord,
that a poor stripling, taken on a sudden,
should (without any contrivance of his own) be so
helped against these authoritative ones.
(Alas! for their authority!) Whether at this Yearly Meeting
the clouds about the minds of these may be dispelled,
I know not; but there is a hard, tough feature about them; they act so much by party,
and suffer family interest to sway, and the like,
and thus J. J. G.`'s works have been (I believe I
might say) forced through that revising meeting;
and now we see the consequences.
Nothing will do but the pure truth!
I have told them plainly, it is no use speaking of their authority,
or that a work has passed that meeting, if it be inconsistent with our principles,
and gives offence to well concerned Friends up and down the country, and in America.

I heartily desire my cousin J. J. G. may be brought
to see the inconsistencies of some of his writings.
I hope there are Aquilas and Priscillas in Philadelphia and elsewhere,
who will show him more perfectly the beauty and the
excellency there is in the Truth and its principles,
and the importance, in one filling the station he does, of perfect consistency.

My dear sisters Mary and Lydia are tolerable; the latter is very delicate;
she is staying with the former during Yearly Meeting.
It is affecting to hear how nearly our loss is felt by Friends with us,
in this annual solemnity.

Dear John, last year, when disabled from attending Yearly Meeting,
was visited by a large number of Friends from the country;
and he used to encourage them and cheer them often,
and show his deep interest in the welfare of our poor little Society.
He is gone to his rest in the Lord; sweet was the assurance,
when I was with him near the last, of his acceptance in the Beloved,
and that the everlasting arms were holding out towards him,
whilst struggling in the last decay of the outward tabernacle.
May we be animated to follow him, as he was concerned to follow his blessed Lord!
Farewell, my dear friend; do write to me, thou hast, never, I think, yet done so.
I remain thy truly affectionate friend.

From Lydia A. Barclay to J. W.

[.signed-section-context-open]
Croydon, 18th of 6th mo.
1838.

[.salutation]
My Dear And Valued Friend,

It was in my heart to have written to thee soon after the
receipt (in 1st mo.) of thy kind and very acceptable letter,
dated 11th mo.
last year, but it was the beginning of a long illness with me,
and I thought perhaps it was better to write after our Yearly Meeting.
My dear friend, I felt it truly kind,
and cause for humble thankfulness to Him in whom are all our fresh springs,
that thou should be drawn thus to write to me,
to strengthen and to comfort me at a very low time,
and amidst much that dismays and oppresses.
Were it not for such cups of refreshment and help,
some of the poor exercised ones would be in danger of fainting by the way.

But how shall I proceed to tell thee of the great affliction that
is permitted us--or how shall I describe our great loss,
in the removal by death of my dearly beloved brother John,
the 11th of last month! but thou canst enter into it and canst feel for us.
He and I were united together in closer bonds than those of outward relationship,
even from the time that he was fourteen and I twelve years of age,
and when he was first drawn into religious thoughtfulness,
and then appeared inclining towards the Church of England;
and ever since that time I have shared in all his exercises, his letters, and his works,
for he has most kindly thought my poor judgment worth consulting
as well as made use of my pen in copying for him.

I cannot tell thee how sweet has been our intercourse of latter years,
especially since they lived at Newington,
where I have gone nearly every month to see them,
(after attending the Morning Meeting) taken my work done and received fresh to do.
But, dear friend, I cannot repine, it is all well ordered by a tender Father,
both for me and for him,--it is for my good this dear prop is taken from me,
and he has joined the just of all generations,
(made perfect through sufferings like their dear Master) whose bright examples
he has been faithfully concerned to hold up to our view in his publications!
His day has been a short one but a full one,
and the work thereof kept pace with the light thereof;
he was just turned forty-one years of age,
nearly the age of our dear ancestor the apologist.
He had the influenza this spring at the same time that I had it,
from which he never recovered, but sunk in very rapid consumption,
only being very ill about a fortnight.
He had gone to Brighton for change of air, and was removed from there to Tunbridge Wells,
in Kent, about three days before his death.

There I went to him, and was favored to witness his peaceful close,
about thirty hours after I got there; he had no pain at all, nor any pang of separation,
but he seemed so redeemed from all, that it was like translation!
He uttered many sweet expressions, the day before his death, which we have put down.
These are the principal.
Alluding to the texts John 1:9th, and viii.
12th, he said, "`It does not say that we shall all at once know all things,
but as they can bear--O, `'tis because they want to know all at once,
not as children learn, that the light is taken away:`" "`praise where it is due,
and thanksgiving and melody.`"
Another time,
"`They say there is no revelation--but what is made manifest to us as our duty,
as the Lord`'s will,
is revelation--this is my belief--I am sure of it--they slight revelation,
but it shall prevail, and the spirit of the Lord shall reign over all.`"

"`None that trust in the Lord shall be confounded,
but they shall be as Mount Zion which can never be removed;
for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.`"
"`You all know my desire to be preserved near the Lord;
I only want to be strengthened and upheld by the Lord,
to be found in him--this is the way of peace.`"
"`The Lord will be your Lord,`" with more relative
to his being a sure refuge and hiding place.
"`We must be faithful to what is made known,--to the smallest
discoveries of the light of Truth.`"

When I was alone with him he said, "`The quiet habitation, dear sister;
thou looks as if thou loved the quiet habitation.
O, how desirable,`" with more about it and greater dedication and faithfulness.
He often said, "`Let us all be still and quiet,`" "`Let us be retired in our minds.`"
That same evening his voice was lifted up in a sweet melody in
which we could occasionally distinguish such words as these:
"`O, Lord, dear Lord, come!`" "`I bless the Lord!`" "`I am the Lord`'s forever.`"
"`Cleave to him, oh,
cleave to him!`" "`Love him with all your heart!`" with "`Hallelujah!`" very
often repeated as a constant and melodious song of praise for hours together.
O, I shall never forget the sweet feeling, about an hour before the close; dear Mary,
after giving him some nourishment,
asked him if he knew her--he replied with a sweet smile, "`Yes,
my Mary;`" had he any pain?`"
No, not any;`" was he happy?`"
Yes, very;`" and then laid down,
and quietly drew his breath shorter and shorter and seemed to fall asleep,
so sweet was the close.

I have dwelt long on this subject, but now will turn to others,
knowing thy feeling heart will excuse me.

I do not know if thou hast heard about dear Samuel Rundell`'s tract on "`Redemption,
Divine Worship, and partaking of the flesh and blood of Jesus.`"
It was first published four years ago;
the second edition was submitted to the Morning Meeting, two years ago last 2nd month;
it was only then read at an adjournment of that meeting, (which I call very unfair,
as but few attend such,) and then given in charge to the committee
(which consists principally of a certain influential class,
but my dear brother John was also one to his humbling!) they, after reading it,
kept it twenty months,
and then the subject was brought forward again last 11th month in the committee,
where it appeared that many or most of them disapproved of it as
tending to undervalue the outward coming and sacrifice of our Saviour,
and embracing views which they thought objectionable.
(I must say that P. Bedford was not present.)

My dear brother John confuted them all, being strengthened to an innocent boldness,
and spoke very closely to several;
he told E. Fry that had she lived in the days of
the reformers she would have been no martyr,
she was so for covering things over with love,
(or something to this effect.) He answered S. Corder closely,
reminding her that in his own parlor,
she had expressed such a sentiment that he told her then, she was a downright Papist.
Samuel Gurney spoke something against William Penn`'s writings,
saying that he was not in unity with his friends; John answered, "`Yes, dear friend,
William Penn was in unity with his friends,
but his friends were for a time afraid of him as
thine are now of thee for the same reason,
because he was so linked with the great,
and the rich and the wise`"--this is as much as I can recollect;
he was kept in great sweetness, and meekness, and peaceful quiet through the whole.
W+++.+++ Allen was the only one who stood up for him and the tract; so they had their own way,
and ordered a letter written to S. R. advising strongly his withdrawing it, and then,
to finish all, "`they wrapt it up`" with the circulation of this report, viz:
that S. R. had withdrawn it!

This is the way, dear friend, that sound things are rejected and discouraged,
while unsound things are violently urged through that meeting! and the reason
of it is that the members of the said committee have the views (or most of them
in different degrees of mixture) contained in J. J. G.`'s private book;
as their reasons for objecting to it were in coincidence with that book.
But I have now the satisfaction to tell thee that in consequence
of dear D. Wheeler`'s strong encouragement and stimulus
to S. R.. he is induced to think of publishing his tract,
notwithstanding;
as he has desired to have a conference with that committee
to defend his own and our early Friends`' views,
which they wholly decline to allow him; so he feels liberated from them.

My brother Rawlinson has or will have it in charge to get out shortly.
Sarah Grubb desired her dear love to thee;
she was raised up to come and bear her noble yet
close testimony among us this Yearly Meeting,
saying that we should yet be sifted more, yea, wiped out,
as a man wipeth a dish turning it upside down!
It is well to sit alone and keep silence in these troublous times! and
how sweet at times to feel united to some at a distance though outwardly
unknown to us--this unity cannot be dissolved by death or by distance,
or by the floods of affliction.

May I send my love in the Lord Jesus to dear Jonathan Evans of Philadelphia?
I consider the preface to Pike and Oxley as dear John`'s dying testimony;
thou wilt greatly like it, and also the book.
It strikes at the accumulation of riches, and getting into superfluities.
O, these have got to a fearful height now over here,
so that ministers and elders who ought to be good examples to the flock,
are instead thereof examples of shaking hands with the worldly
spirit in all things! there are but a few whose hands are clean,
and such go under reproach as narrow;
but we must be content to be as our Lord and his Spirit ever was and will be,
contrary to the worldly spirit.

We are mingling with the mass of other professors, as dear Sarah Grubb said we should be,
by our mingling with them in benevolent matters, even in the Yearly Meeting of 1820,
and told us to note it in our pocketbooks,
and said that we should thereby get to think there
was no good in this query or the other query,
till all the discipline would by degrees fall to the ground;
so now this is coming to pass rapidly in reality or life,
however fair the superstructure or form may still appear.

My Beloved Friend John Wilbur,

I am truly glad to avail myself of this opening, to assure thee, my dear friend,
that thou art, and hast been, much and often in our remembrance.
How should it be otherwise,
whilst we have been witnessing the developments of those exercising prospects with which
thy poor afflicted spirit was at times well-nigh overwhelmed whilst within our borders!
The recollection of some seasons, wherein my own mind was permitted to participate,
though, perhaps, in a small measure, with thine, is still fresh in my remembrance.
Many and sore have been our afflictions, and they are not yet ended.
I sometimes think it is only a part of the roughest
of the mixture which has been sifted from us.
There is much of a more specious and refined nature remaining, which, if I mistake not,
is still more opposed to the simplicity of the Truth, as it is in Jesus.

Ah, what a subtle enemy is ours! working in a mystery.
Loud, indeed, is the call to us, every one, "`Let him that thinketh he standeth,
take heed lest he fall.`"
My beloved husband has, I think,
been wonderfully delivered from a load of oppression which long pressed him down,
and now seems to me and many of his friends, to have been hidden as in a cave,
and thereby prepared to take his place in the midst of a little band, who,
though in their own estimation but as a feeble few,
have yet been favored to stand faithfully,
and bear the different assaults which have been permitted to try them.

Well, I could write more, but am obliged to conclude,
as this goes by the hand of a friend who waits for it.

My dear D. D. desires me to give his dear love to thee.
Farewell, my dear friend.
In the precious feeling of love and near unity,

[.signed-section-closing]
I remain thy very affectionate friend,

Philadelphia, 2nd of Second Month, 1839.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend John Wilbur,

When just on the eve of taking my departure from New York for this city,
thy letter of the 22nd ult.
was received; and truly welcome it was to hear from thee once more upon thy own shores.
My time has been fully occupied ever since, in Burlington and its neighborhood,
until yesterday, when I left, and got here in the afternoon.
On leaving England for North America,
I had no defined plan in prospect of what I might have to do when I got there;
but it was clear to my mind that the first step which
I had to take was to make the best of my way thither;
and since my arrival I have found that I must be content to live one day alone,
and am thankful to be able to say that thus far I have been graciously
supported and helped along to my own admiration and comfort and peace.
I am not, however, insensible that bonds and afflictions abide me;
and I do not feel any disposition to shrink from feeling the burden of them,
believing that if they be accepted for Christ`'s sake and his gospel`'s; in his own time,
if patiently abode under,
the freedom and liberty and consolations of the gospel will
also be permitted at seasons to abound to his praise.

Without anticipating more tribulation to be my portion
than what falls to the lot of other mortals,
I cannot conceive it should be otherwise than a day of suffering
with those who are called upon to fill up a share of that which
remains for the body`'s sake according to their measure,
when those things which make truly desolate, and destitute of the Divine presence,
stand where they ought not,
(in the place which should be holy,) instead of that pure vital religion which the spirituality
of the gospel dispensation bestows upon all that believe in its teachings;
and it is these only that know it to be the power of God
unto salvation from sin and transgression.

How many are contenting themselves at this day,
even though making high profession of the Christian religion,
with a mere outward declaration of "`glad tidings of good things,
and great joy to all people,`" without coming to the heartfelt
knowledge of this very gospel within themselves,
though preached in and to every creature under heaven,
in language as intelligible as that of the angel which John
saw fly through the midst of heaven with it in his hand,
who cried with a loud voice,
"`Fear God and give glory to him,`" and which is only hidden from
those "`whose minds are blinded by the god of this world,
lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ should shine unto them!`"

It is much more palatable to the creature to be fed
with pleasant food from the tree of knowledge,
which never can sustain the soul and was never intended for man to feed upon,
though good in its proper place, (and if to a proper extent cultivated,
allowable,) than to have the attention turned to that holy
principle of gospel light which shines in every heart,
which would set a man`'s sins in order before him without flattery or deceit,
whereby he might be induced to commence the great and necessary work,
and learn the first principles of the doctrines of Christ,
which is "`repentance toward God,
and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ,`" by faith in the power of the
Holy Spirit to purify and cleanse the heart from every defilement.
"`Repent and believe the gospel,`" "`Repent and obey the
gospel,`" is coarse food in the present day.

Farewell, my dear friend; desiring my love to thyself and family,

[.salutation]
My Dear Thomas,

The loss of our dear aged friend Jonathan Evans has indeed filled my heart with sorrow;
and the question has arisen in my almost desponding mind,
is it intended by the God of Israel,
on account of the great iniquity of his people and of the priesthood,
to suffer the ark of his testimony to go into the hands of the Philistines,
as he did formerly by reason of the profaning of their sacred office by the house of Eli?
One after another of the most valiant among the few left to give glory
to his name on account of Israel`'s deliverance from his former enemies,
are removed and called away to their everlasting mansions!
Great gain, indeed, to them;
but how will it fare with the solitary ones who are thus stripped and bereaved
of their strength and counsel in this day of treading down by the enemy?
But if He disband the elder warriors altogether, as having fulfilled their commission,
will he raise up another army from the ranks of an early walk,
and send them into the field against the mighty?

Yesterday, before receiving the sorrowful tidings,
I was reading in the history of Israel`'s kings and their warfare,
and the great strait to which the armies of Israel, Judah, and Edom were brought,
in their going forth against Moab, for want of water,
and thereby induced to seek counsel of the Lord; and when inquiry was made for a prophet,
one of the king`'s servants answered and said, "`here is Elisha the son of Shaphat,
which poured water on the hands of Elijah!`"
My mind was much interested in this beautiful description
of the young prophet and his mission.
He had been called and anointed by Elijah; had waited on him,
and received a double portion of his spirit,
had caught the falling mantle when Elijah ascended up to heaven,
and became a prophet in his room.

And subsequently, in the midst of my bemoaning of Israel`'s loss in our day,
I was instructed by a recurrence to the ordering of Infinite Wisdom in that day,
when the condition of his people was exceedingly forlorn,
by reason of a forsaking of their testimonies,
yet he saw meet to take away from them him who was called
"`the chariot of Israel,`" but not without a succession.
And a little hope revives, that there will be found "`one of a city,
and two of a family,`" called to uphold the ancient testimonies of Israel,
who will at least have known as much as to have poured
water upon the hands of those who have ascended,
and gone before them!

In much love, I remain thine, etc.,

Long ago--years ago, when I was a little child, I remember how I loved,
and how I was concerned to endeavor to keep near those who kept near the Lord,
and how earnestly I desired then to be able to see, spiritually, who were near him;
and I remember how it was opened to me then that it was necessary
for me to keep my own eyes--the eye of my mind--to him,
and upon him, and "`in him,`" not only for my own safe condition and standing,
but also it was clearly and immediately opened to my view that even those
who had attained to a good condition--to a heavenly and honorable condition,
might lose it and fall from it; and yet this might be the case when, as to the outward,
there might be little change in the appearance;
so that the mind must be kept principally and primarily
in the "`Head,`" and not look to men or follow men,
any farther than they followed him and were found in him.

I desire to speak it to the praise of that grace,
everlasting lovingkindness and tender mercy, by which not only I am what I am,
but by which alone I have been preserved from still
clinging to and following after men who,
having once been favored with it,
and richly adorned and eminently qualified by it for usefulness,
and thereby made as examples to the flock, have turned from it to wantonness.
But how many there are who practise upon the false principle,
"`once in grace always in grace,`" however unwilling they may be to own it;
so that if a man has once had a name to live,
and especially if his reputation has been great and generally acknowledged,
when he loses his life and becomes spiritually dead, to all intents and purposes,
nothing remaining but a lifeless carcass,
and even this unlike that of the prophet who was slain by the lion,
(for his carcass was not eaten,
nor the ass on which he rode torn,) he must still be honored and cherished,
as if he were a living

Farewell.

[.salutation]
My Dear And Valued Friend,

I hope I am not unsuitably intruding by writing before my usual time,
but I thought it was due to thy deeply exercised mind to acknowledge the comfort
it was to receive thy very kind and acceptable letter of 12th month last,
and though it contained truly sorrowful tidings,
yet it was a confirmation to see that we were one in feeling
and in suffering respecting a prominent individual,
and that the fears and feelings of a little band
of suffering ones have been entirely realized.
Oh! the bright accounts that I hear from different parts,
speaking of the life and presence of the Master attending the ministry of such an one,
and from those who are much looked up to by some,
and therefore it is more likely that even the chosen ones should be deceived!

But I have been reminded of the injunction, "`When they shall say, See here! or,
Lo he is there! believe it not, go not after them,`" and also,
"`see that ye be not troubled,`" (at what we see and hear,) "`for these
things must needs be,`" "`in your patience possess ye your souls.`"
One is ready to think that, ere long,
something surely will occur to show more plainly where such are,
and how they are departed from the life of Truth,
for all the world seems gone after them, and the doctrine of this spirit is (as J. Steel,
the honest ploughman formerly said,
see Pike and Oxley) so smooth that none can pick a hole in it;
nevertheless the tendency is to scatter from the life!

Some of my few and mournful correspondents are ready to say,
(in beholding and feeling these things,
as well as the sad torrent of liberty out of the cross that seems
to overwhelm us here and to sweep all before it,) Alas! there is
no hope! and truly in low and discouraging seasons,
which are not few, I am ready to join in their mournful forebodings.
This spirit of deception has lamentably gone forth with rapid stride,
the above individual setting the example in chopping round from
Beaconism to what is called and passes for ancient Quakerism,
(the imitation is so exact,) others of different
degrees of powerful influence have followed,
the bait has been eagerly swallowed, the golden pill gone down,
and the effects have seemed so good that almost all are deceived into unity with it!

How it does remind me of dear Sarah Grubb`'s dream, a few years ago!
She dreamed she was sitting in meeting,
and saw something very excellent and beautiful come in at the door,
and as it entered it was immediately so admired by all and wondered at for its beauty,
that all made way for it and caressed it,
and it went right up into the ministers`' gallery,
and crept about the feet and legs of the Friends there,
and all loved it and made way for it,
and it crept up higher and higher about their bodies,
till at last it squeezed the very life out of them!

Alas, this is too true!
Oh, my dear friend, the luxury that is crept in amongst us here is sad indeed;
the houses, tables, carriages,
gardens and children of our ministers and elders
are examples of shaking hands with the worldly spirit,
under various pretences, and others, of course, follow it;
so that there is very little true simplicity left amongst us,
except amongst the poor or country Friends and some weak ones like myself,
that must bear our singular testimony against that
which we were in the beginning brought out of;
(surely George Fox would have no unity with us, but would cry,
Woe! against us;) and the consequence of this is that either
the cross (the power of God) is not preached amongst us,
or else it is not it cannot be truly preached with convincing energy;
for I confess it seems a paradox to me, how any can really and truly preach the cross,
testify against the worldly spirit, or exhort to faithfulness in any degree,
whilst their own conduct contradicts what they preach!
and yet this is continually the case,
to my dismay and pain.

But I fear I shall make thee sad with my lamentations!
Yet, dear friend, there is a little faithful remnant with us as with you,
as it were "`one of a city and two of a tribe,`" and they are a comfort one to another,
and I believe also to others that look on their ways.
(Ezekiel 14:22) May they be preserved as in the hollow of the Almighty hand,
whilst this sifting is going on, for surely we must have more sifting and shaking still,
and (as John says in one of his letters) "`more falling away,
that the man of sin may be revealed and more and more discovered,
and that Zion may be redeemed through judgment and saved as by fire,
and the overflowing scourge must pass through, when the refuge of lies is swept away,
and the sure foundation established and manifested, and when the Lord is about his work,
his strange work.`"

Newport, 3lst of 8th mo., 1889.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

Sure I am,
that nothing which is of the right stamp can contradict the spirit of our discipline,
as it was originally framed.
(I will not speak of modern times.) Still,
George Fox and other worthies never intended to limit the
Holy One of Israel from putting forth his own power,
and magnifying his own name, in such a way as pleased him.
They only intended to limit and keep down, by the discipline,
wrong things of the unauthorized activity of the creature;
and they had the true spirit of judgment,
and could discern the stamp of Divine authority,
when it appeared in an unusual way--a way contrary to the deductions of fallen man,
with all his boasted powers of reason, order,
and the rule of decency and right (so called).
How would the prophet Isaiah have fared if he had appeared
in our day as he did formerly,--a sign to Egypt and Ethiopia?
Or how would Thomas Aldam, and a host of other worthies, have fared amongst us?

In a view of our dead, cold, formal state and condition,
I was led to think of these things.
We seem very much to have set up for ourselves;
and to be under no obligation to wait to know the mind of Truth.
And I freely confess it would be no surprise to me,
if the Lord of the whole earth should raise up,
qualify and exercise some of his servants, who are not in an outwardly gathered state,
in such a way as would make both the ears of them that heard it, tingle,
and the eyes of them that saw it, to fail of seeing it in its true light and bearing.

The whole course of his Providence,
and of the dispensation both of his mercy and of his judgments to backsliders,
whether we look at the people of Israel after the flesh,
or the apostate Christian church,
(and especially at the breaking forth of Truth in the seventeenth
century,) has hitherto been attended by signs and wonders,
which baffled all the wisdom and prudence of the natural man,
and which such could neither receive nor believe, although it was declared unto them,
however high their profession might be!

And in consideration of the fact, that no people since the apostolic times,
have ever approached so near to the purity and power then witnessed, as Friends,
and also of our degeneracy, formality, carnality, and lukewarmness, at present,
it seems as if the language was applicable to us: "`You only have I known,
(in comparison with others, and in respect to the nearness of communion,
and the openness of vision,) therefore you will I punish for all your iniquities!`"
And if one woe will not turn us back to Truth there
will be another and another,--even overturn,
overturn, overturn, until He comes whose right it is to reign,
who is wonderful in working and almighty in power!

We were glad to hear of thy engagements, both epistolary and in the line of the ministry;
and of the latter being owned by Him who still putteth forth his own,
and goeth before them, and blesseth their labors,
even causing those who preach the gospel of his grace, to live of the gospel;
and although they oftentimes go forth weeping, yet,
bearing "`precious seed,`" they will doubtless return again rejoicing,
bringing their sheaves of peace with them; as I doubt not has been the case with thee.

I am thy sure friend,

Having felt drawings in my mind for several years, to visit most,
or all the Quarterly Meetings belonging to New England Yearly Meeting,
and obtaining a certificate from our Monthly Meeting of their unity with the concern,
I left home on the 29th of 11th mo., 1839, and reaching Newport next day,
attended their two meetings on the day following;
and although the meeting then was in a condition
which made it very trying for me to sit with them,
yet I was favored in mercy, after a distressing night,
to have pretty open service in both.
On second day I attended the funeral of Sarah Congdon,
(my sister-in-law,) and had a short,
awakening testimony in the meeting held on the occasion.

On third day morning, I left Rhode Island with my beloved friend, Henry Gould,
as companion, for New Bedford, and lodged at our friend Seth Davis`'s,
and next morning got to the Select Quarterly Meeting at New Bedford;
in which I was silent.
The day following, in the public Quarterly Meeting, way was made,
and a door of utterance was given, to speak of the greatness and goodness of God,
and the exalted nature of his kingdom,
and the condition of being stayed on him and trusting in him.
In this meeting strength was mercifully given to declare the Truth
in a manner truly relieving to my tried and afflicted mind;
and free access to the feet of Divine mercy was granted in prayer,
to the praise of God`'s holy name.
On sixth day, we had a satisfactory meeting at Long Plain, and returned to New Bedford.

On seventh day, finding no opportunity to take passage to Nantucket,
whither I felt myself bound, we visited several families in a religious way,
to good satisfaction, and some others in a social manner.
On first day morning, we took passage in a steam vessel,
with the Friends from that Island,
where we safely arrived in time for the afternoon meeting, which proved an open time;
and at the close, a meeting was appointed for second day evening,
to which the youth were particularly invited, with others who generally attend.
This meeting was very satisfactory and relieving,
strength being given to make a renewed call to a faithful support of our testimonies.

While on the Island, we visited a number of families, such as were sick and afflicted,
and unable to attend meetings,
and had divers opportunities with many dear Friends at our lodgings;
in all which service we seemed to find an open door in testimony,
and sometimes in solemn supplication, I believe, to the renewal of the strength of many.
On fourth day, feeling clear of the Island, we left it, and landed at Falmouth,
where next day we had a favored meeting, and great peace ensued.
The day following, went to Yarmouth, and on seventh day, had a good meeting there.
After this we went to Sandwich, and on first day, attended their meeting,
in which help was graciously afforded to preach the gospel
in some degree in the demonstration of the Spirit,
and with power.
Next day we went to John Davis`'s to dine, and then to our beloved friends,
James and Sarah Tucker`'s to lodge; and the day following to Fall River, where next day,
the 18th of 12th mo., and fourth of the week, we attended their midweek meeting,
in which strength was mercifully given to exalt the name of the Lord over all.
Here my companion, Henry Gould, left me, and went home;
and I arrived home on the 21st of the month, and found all well;
and sweet peace was my reward.

On fourth day, the 8th of 1st mo., 1840,
I set out on my visit to Friends in the Eastern States,
and went by public conveyance to Lynn, where I arrived on seventh day, and on first day,
was at their fore and afternoon meetings.
Notwithstanding Friends are here in a mournful state of dissension,
which made it appear to me exceedingly difficult to speak
among them in a manner to divide the word aright,
yet the blessed Shepherd was mercifully pleased to go before,
and to guide in a way which I trust none could gainsay or condemn.
On third day I attended the Select Quarterly Meeting at Salem,
and was therein led to invite those present to gather to Christ, our Holy Head,
that his presence and his word might be our stay and staff in this day of trouble,
and that our souls might be anchored in God.

On fifth day attended the Quarterly Meeting,
and large and weighty service therein fell to my lot.
On sixth day, I went to West Newbury, and had a meeting there in the evening,
to pretty good satisfaction, and lodged with my friends Robert and Susan Brown.
Seventh day, these friends went with me to Amesbury, where we lodged at Philip Jones`'s,
whose wife, with her Christian cheerfulness and hearty kindness,
helped me to take courage in holding up my head in hope.
At this place I had a highly favored meeting,
in which divers Christian doctrines were opened and delivered to those present,
in a degree I trust, of the right authority;
and way was mercifully made to the house of prayer.
In the afternoon, I had a trying meeting at Seabrook,
but way was at length made to sound an alarm amongst them.

From hence, Edward Gove kindly took me to Dover, where we had an appointed meeting,
to my great relief.
Here I lodged at my kind relatives, William and Hannah Wilbur`'s;
and afterwards went to Lower Rochester, and had a meeting there at ten next morning,
which, though somewhat open, was not very satisfactory, owing I believe,
to great unfaithfulness in some.
The same afternoon, I attended the Select Quarterly Meeting,
at Upper Rochester,--a trying season to me.
Next day I attended the Quarterly Meeting, which was small, on account of a great snow.
But in this meeting, way was early made to preach Christ, the Resurrection and the Life,
and to invite Friends to first principles--to that high
and holy calling to which our predecessors bore testimony,
and to the way in which they walked.

Next day I went back to Dover, where we attended a marriage,
but it was my lot to be silent.
After this I proceeded to North Berwick,
where a prospect which had been increasing on my mind for some days,
of visiting the families of Friends of this Monthly Meeting, seemed so to mature,
that I thought it best to call a meeting of the select members,
in order to open my prospect to them, for their advice and concurrence therein;
which met their approbation; and after a good meeting on first day,
I proceeded in this weighty service, having for company, Joshua Jenkins and wife,
Joshua Meader and John 500. Lang, though not all at the same time.
In the course of the week, this visit was accomplished,
with the attendance of Oak Woods and Elliot meetings,
all to good satisfaction as to the discharge of duty.

On seventh day, the 1st of 2nd mo., I went to Westbrook, and on first day,
attended meeting at Falmouth and Portland; the former, through close searching labor,
proved a favored meeting; the latter, very trying,
though considerable labor was bestowed.
On second day I went to Gorham, and next day had a meeting there, pretty satisfactory;
and on fourth day, attended the Select Quarterly Meeting at Windham,
which was a comfortable season to me.
Next day was the Public Quarterly Meeting, which was an exercising time to me,
and silence was my lot.

When the Meeting for Discipline was opened, there was a person who had been disowned,
that refused to leave;
on which account the meeting was adjourned to 10 o`'clock next morning;
of which I was glad,
because it seemed so unsettled that I apprehended
I should not be able to throw off my burden.
At the adjournment next morning, I obtained liberty to visit the women`'s meeting,
in which way was made for extensive and fervent labor;
and on returning into the men`'s meeting, Truth opened my mouth in its own demonstration,
and its power prevailed, greatly to the comfort of the living,
and divers Friends expressed their thankfulness for the favor this day extended to us.

After meeting I went to Brunswick, where, on first day, I attended their meeting,
in which I had extensive service, both in testimony and in supplication.
This was a very large meeting, and the power of Truth overshadowed it,
to the praise of the Lord`'s great name, to whom it belongs!
On the same afternoon, we travelled to Litchfield,
where next day we had a favored meeting,
in which the great doctrines of the true gospel ministry,
and the baptism of the Holy Ghost were largely explained in the authority of Truth.
It afterwards appeared that a number of the Baptists and their minister, were present.
The same afternoon we had a meeting at Winthrop, which was long silent and painful,
in consequence, as I believed, of a careless, lukewarm state, prevalent amongst them.

Next day, at Hallowell, we had a good meeting; and from thence I went to Vassalboro,
and the day following, attended the Select Quarterly Meeting there,
where a little labor rested on me.
The next day, I attended the public Quarterly Meeting,
and much arduous service fell to my lot, both in testimony and supplication;
and Truth prevailed.
On sixth and seventh days, the 14th and 15th of 2nd mo., I had meetings at the Outlet,
China Neck, South China and China, of which the last was silent on my part,
and that at the Neck long silent and laborious,
but ended pretty well;--the other two were good meetings.
On first day we had an open, good meeting at Albion,
as also the next day at their Monthly Meeting, at Unity;--both, I trust,
profitable seasons.

Next morning attended China Monthly Meeting, which was, to me, a deeply instructive time,
in which strength and wisdom were mercifully given,
and prayer and praise were humbly offered to Him, who did, in unbounded mercy,
deign to preside over this gathering.
The day following, I went to Vassalboro, and attended the Monthly Meeting there,
in which the subject of the New Covenant was demonstrated,
and its nature in a twofold sense, explained; Christ without us, and Christ within us,
together with the doctrine latterly, so much insisted on,
of justification by faith in the paschal sacrifice alone, without regard to obedience;
the fallacy of which doctrine was exposed.
After this meeting, we went to Sidney, and next day attended the Monthly Meeting there,
in which the necessity, as well as excellency of gathering to the Shiloh,
and of waiting upon him, was pressingly set forth.

The same afternoon, went to Litchfield, and next day attended Monthly Meeting there;
in which Christ, both crucified and risen again, the hope of glory,
was preached in the demonstration.
The next day we travelled to Durham, and attended their meeting the following day;
which was long silent,
I believe because the people were looking unto man rather than gathering unto Christ.
On second day, went to Falmouth, and next day to Windham,
where we had a meeting the same afternoon--long silent and exercising,
but concluded pretty well.
The day following I wrote to my wife and children, and called on several Friends,
and the day after, went to Limington, where next day was held Windham Monthly Meeting;
and after meeting, went to Parsonsfield, where, on seventh day morning,
we had a meeting which was open and much favored; and in the afternoon,
travelled about thirty miles to North Sandwich, and next morning had a meeting there,
in which my exercised mind got some relief.
In the afternoon, I had a meeting at South Sandwich,
(silent,) and after it visited a sick Friend and her sister, to good satisfaction;
and then went to Ezra Meader`'s and lodged.

Next day, travelled to Gilmanton, and the day following,
had a meeting in the forenoon with Friends, and in the afternoon at the Academy,
with the Theological Students and others; both to good satisfaction.
On fourth day I went to Pittsfield, and had a meeting there the same evening,
in which much counsel was administered.
From thence, the next day, went to Epping, and had a little meeting there in the evening.
Here I lodged with my aged friends, Benjamin and Abigail Folsom;
and on fourth day morning, went to the railway, near Exeter, N. H.,
and through Boston to Providence, and lodged with my children, John T. and Sarah Kenyon,
near Pawtucket, and the day following, going by railroad to Westerly,
lodged there with my children, Ethan and Anna Foster, and next day, the 5th of 3rd mo.,
1841, reached home, thankful to find my dear wife and family well.

I had travelled in this winter journey, from seven to eight hundred miles,
was preserved in good bodily health, and also, as I trust,
in the line of Divine appointment; and enabled, in a good degree,
to fulfill the service allotted me, and to return with the reward of peace,
through the condescending mercy and help of Him who had called for this service,
and without which it could not have been performed to any profit;
and whether it has been to any, or how much,
I leave to him who saw meet that this labor should be bestowed upon his people.
May all the honor, and the glory, be rendered unto the Lord God and the Lamb, which was,
and is, and is to come!

In the 4th mo., following, I went with a certificate,
and attended Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, to a good degree of satisfaction;
after which I attended several meetings in that city,
and some on my way returning in Bucks County.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

I have but once put my pen to paper to any of my
dear friends since returning from my eastern journey,
and that one time was to T. and E. Robson.
To them I have written pretty fully on the signs of the times,
and thereby obtained much relief.
I believe them not to have intentionally departed from our doctrines;
but so long as they continue to apologize for the palpable errors of their countryman,
J+++.+++ J. Gurney,
or to cherish a disposition to find fault with those who
are conscientiously making a stand against his errors,
I fear they will be in great danger.

It seems that his upholders and supporters have made these Friends
believe that they are perfectly sound in our ancient doctrines,
and thereby have obtained great advantage and much influence over them.
And I do consider this professed soundness in Quakerism,
both in the leader and in his followers,
to be the very worst feature in their whole system;
because it shows a great want of sincerity, and is fraught with such deception,
that many honest minds are liable to be influenced and deluded thereby.
I apprehend there is scarcely an iniquity among those professing the Christian name,
more displeasing in the Divine sight than that of hypocrisy,--than
that of men`'s pretending to be what they are not.

But God will not be mocked; such as men sow, such shall they reap.
And peradventure this heinous trait of character prevails among
none more than with those who have taken and grasped the lead and
dominion over the professing churches of the Christian name,
and are lording it over the heritage.
But the domination of such,
over those bodies which are themselves enveloped in dead formality,
does not seem to call so loudly for the Divine indignation and judgment,
as in cases where the Lord`'s sincere and living children
are groaning under the weight of their oppressive hands.
But these of the latter description,
if their eyes and cries are singly directed unto him, and their whole trust is in him,
and they are also endeavoring to keep the word of his patience, will not fail to witness,
in time, his promise of deliverance verified to them.

I returned my eastern certificate to our Monthly Meeting,
and produced many indorsements thereon, which appeared satisfactory to Friends.
I then proposed to the meeting a prospect which was
fresh with me whilst yet in the North,
of attending Philadelphia Yearly Meeting,
and the meeting freely certified their unity with my going.
I expect, tomorrow week, to set out on my journey thither.

With much love to all your family, and all other of my dear friends on that island,
I conclude, and remain, in great nearness, thine as ever,

Reigate, Surrey, 6th mo., 9th, 1840.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

I hasten to acknowledge thy letter of 2nd of last month,
(received on the 30th,) which I felt very kind,
and though I too soon came to the end of it yet it was very acceptable; a word in season,
for had thou known the trials and exercises I have lately had to pass through,
thou couldst not have written more strengtheningly.
Ah! were it not for a cup of cold water, as it were from time to time, handed in mercy,
I fear some of us weak ones would be very near fainting;
for the tribulations of the present day are many and sore! and when we, some of us,
look around, upon our poor Society,
and hear the reproaches of the enemy "`as with a sword in
our bones,`" we are ready to say with the Psalmist,
"`the enemy hath smitten my life down to the ground, he hath persecuted my soul,
he hath made me to dwell in darkness as those that have been long dead;
therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me, my heart within me is desolate!`"

Yet oh,
that in the midst of mourning we may "`remember the days of old,`"
(as he did,) meditate on the Lord`'s wonderful and gracious works,
even on the mightiness of his power, and therefore stretch forth our hands unto him,
"`thirsting for him as a thirsty land,`" waiting for his counsel, for his humbling,
for his strengthening unto all faithfulness and patience, to the very end! then, surely,
will he cause us to know the way wherein we should walk.
He will enable us to do and suffer his holy will,
and lead us into the land of uprightness!
Oh! may we lean increasingly on him, without over anxiety; for it is his work,
and he will take care of his own, dear Church,
(were not the wings of an eagle given her to make her escape from the dragon into the
wilderness?) and he will keep her true children as the apple of his eye!

Oh, the preciousness, the peaceful quietude,
the powerfulness of that state of unity with the Divine will, where the true worship,
the true amen, reigns over all trials and tribulations, so that nothing is a surprisal,
nothing too hard,--yet the language of heavenly love is breathed,
"`Gather them if it please thee, O, most Mighty!`"
May I be brought more and more into this state, by any means,
is the earnest desire of my soul!
Thy last letter to Rawlinson, and this to me, is deeply interesting and instructive;
how encouraging to hear how thou wert helped over thy trials through evil report!

How marvellously are the faithful enabled to confront the fierce lions, yea,
out of weakness are made strong, and given to labor in demonstration of the Spirit,
and with heavenly power, to the strengthening the hands of their dear fellow-sufferers,
and to the glory and praise of Him to whom, indeed, it alone belongs,
and be it ascribed by the whole house of the spiritual Israel forever!
How wisely you seem to be going to work, and with what unanimity!
You are a more free and independent people; we are so shackled by rank and custom,
politeness and fear.
And these great folks are so connected by marriage
with the principal Friends all over our little island,
and they much rule our Yearly Meeting!

Nay, I think I may say to thee, (for, no doubt,
thou felt similarly when over here,) that two or
three men rule the highest meetings in London,
assisted by two or three women! and our dear, country Friends cannot see through it,
(at least, many of them,) but think all things are well,
and they speak of the favored meeting, etc., etc.
Cheshire and Staffordshire Quarterly Meeting sent up a proposition to the Yearly Meeting,
to revise the rules respecting the revision of MSS.
by the Morning Meeting; it was put into the hands of a committee,
(of whom Rawlinson was one, and spoke closely on the subject,
I heard,) there it was handled about,
few of our country Friends knowing the true state of the Morning Meeting,
and still fewer daring to speak!

But dear George Jones did speak manfully, and in such a way as I hope may stick by them,
and do some good; although the matter ended without any alteration of the rules,
(just as one might expect from the above overbearing,) but
country Friends were encouraged to attend the Morning Meeting!
Oh, my dear friend, the worldly wisdom and policy,
the maneuvering and contrivance there is amongst us in these that
ought to be solemn meetings of weighty ministers and elders,
and other exercised Friends!
But alas! when people go from the lowly principle of Truth in their own hearts,
can we marvel at any deceit or underhand doings?

I know not whether Rawlinson has answered thy last yet; but thou,
misunderstood what he said about the Meeting for Sufferings.
They are too much in unity with J. J. G. to wish to hear anything against him.
What dost thou think of a member of that meeting
writing a tract in favor of marrying first-cousins,
and getting his Monthly Meeting,
(a weak one,) to send up a proposition to the same
effect to the last Quarterly Meeting at London!
It seemed the general feeling that the early part of our Select
Yearly Meeting and our men`'s and women`'s meetings were favored;
no outbreakings, the evil seemed kept down, and we had more quiet.

But, I have been ready to think, whether the enemy does not hush things up in this way,
in order to carry on his own wily purposes more hiddenly and surely.
The answers were very low; especially, I thought, the select ones;
yet the summary was drawn up fair, as if all was right with us.
O, I felt it was as a lie in our mouth!
In the second week, it seemed as if man`'s wisdom and activity got up more,
and the conclusion of each of our three above meetings was trying, no quiet pause,
but breaking up all in a hurry, after several trying supplications.
It is said +++_______+++ and +++_______+++ are quite come back again to ancient views!

If this were the case, surely a public confession,
or condemnation of their outgoings would be the first token of amendment, or,
at any rate, to keep the mouth in the dust.
Ah! it is merely turning a new face and appearance upward, as it were,
when the root of the matter remains the same at the bottom!
This is what one feels, as to many amongst us, who speak words of ancient doctrine;
being quite turned round from what they once were!
But it seems like mere empty sound.
There wants a more thorough breaking to pieces, and bringing to naught,
that old things may be done away, and all things be made new;
for it will not do to be building with the old rubbish.

My health has been very declining;
last winter I was urged by my friends to consult
a noted Dr. in Warwickshire in the spring,
who told me my lungs are diseased; but he hoped, by care,
I might be spared awhile longer.
His remedies were blessed to me, but, my dear friend, I am not sanguine, nor yet anxious,
believing my times are in good hands;
only desiring to be made ready through redeeming
love and mercy for the awful summons whenever sent!
I have, indeed, a sweet and peaceful outward home in this retired and beautiful corner;
yet I do trust the better, even the heavenly home, is not out of mind,
where I often long to be, if so I might be permitted;
and surely what unutterable grace it would be! eternity
would be too short to sing His praise!

I am inclined to tell such of thy dear family as are mothers, that Mary Tanner,
(a minister of Sidcot, where we have a public school, and whose eldest son, quite young,
is also a minister,) was engaged in a sweet and instructive way,
during our Yearly Meeting, to the mothers amongst us,
advising them against a superfluous and ornamental education of their daughters,
and alluding to the great deal of fancy needlework now taught and allowed.
She said she had often viewed these things as like
taking a deal of pains in ornamenting a flower-garden,
whilst the culture of the lowly, weighty grain of the fields,
from which a satisfactory and enriching harvest might be expected, was neglected!
I thought there was much in it;
for alas! there are many things now allowed and used amongst our dear young people,
which are very inconsistent with the simplicity of the Truth,
and in unison with the worldly spirit, which we ought to testify against

With dear love, I remain thy nearly united friend,

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend Thomas R. Gould,

I still feel the many obligations which I am under
to thee and other sympathizing Friends on your island;
and those feelings, I trust, are full of gratitude, and accompanied with a desire,
if not a prayer, that the blessing of Heaven may continue to rest upon you,
through your continued faithfulness to the best of all causes,
and dwelling near to him and with him who can command the
winds and the seas to be still and they will obey him;
and to them that keep the word of his patience,
his covenant and his faithfulness are everlasting and unchangeable.

With what confidence then may we trust in him, and continually call upon him in hope,
in that hope which beareth up the plaintive mind, and rescues it from despair!
And truly, my dear friend,
we can both say that it has been through this trust
and this hope in the Lord`'s power alone,
that we have been preserved from falling a prey to the jaws of the devourer.
May we then give thanks for the mercies which we have already received,
and take courage in those which still await us, if we will fight under his banner,
and keep our eyes intently upon the ensign of his command,
under which no weapon that is formed against us shall ever prosper.

And I feel it right to acknowledge to thee that I have recently been a
witness of the interposition of his providence and of his power,
in covering the head of a feeble and sometimes almost despairing soldier in his army,
and causing the arrows of the archers to fall harmless at his feet;
may his name be praised!
The committee^
footnote:[A committee of Rhode Island`'s Select Quarterly Meeting,
for a particular account of which see J.W.`'s Narrative and Exposition, page 36,
as well as a synopsis of the same in the present volume.]
have not been wanting, heretofore, in apparent endeavors to provoke and to aggravate,
in order, as I believe, to obtain from me some unguarded act or expression,
of which they might take an advantage.
And now, at the Select Quarter, in order for a still greater effort to reproach me,
J+++.+++ Header requested their appointment to be read,
when R. Greene reported that they had endeavored to attend to their appointment,
as way had opened for it,
but that their labors had not as yet been attended with much success,
and elicited the encouragement of the meeting for further service,
a record of their report was made, and of the encouragement to proceed.

But the commandment of the King was to answer them not, and so the thing passed over.
But when I took these men and their abettors by the hand, at the close of the meeting,
and looked them full in the face, their countenances fell.
However, they cited me to meet them at 3 o`'clock that afternoon, which I declined to do,
perceiving them to be much excited,
and I thought best to give them a little time to cool,
and proposed the following afternoon or evening.
But I feel entirely resigned to the controlling hand
of Him who can permit or overrule all events,
as in wisdom may answer best his righteous purposes.
I am more and more assured that deliverance will be one day wrought for us,
if we are wise and bold in the cause.

Farewell,

From J. W. to a Concerned Young Friend.

[.signed-section-context-open]
Hopkinton, 8th mo., 2nd, 1840.

[.letter-heading]
To My Dear Friend M+++_______+++,

I have thought much of thee of late, in the fresh feelings, too,
of that love which knoweth no bounds, but goeth beyond sea and land,
wherever those may be found who are prepared to receive
and to reciprocate its fresh and living springs,
throughout the whole family and heritage of the Lord`'s faithful children; and I believe,
my dear young friend, that it is thy chiefest concern so to live, and so to walk,
as that he would deign to number thee among his chosen followers.
Well, my dear,
if thou wilt patiently endure all things for His sake who
has touched and ravished thy heart with his heavenly love,
he will not only number thee among those whom he delighteth to honor,
but he will make thee his by adoption, and prepare and sanctify thy heart,
and make it more and more a fit receptacle for the
aboundings of his love and good presence.

And if thou continuest to delight to live near and to dwell with him there,
as well in the depths as in the heights, as well in his judgments as in his praise,
as well in tribulation and peril as in a joyful deliverance from them,
then will he increase thy experience and enlarge thy understanding in him,
and in his wisdom and power, as well as in his unspeakable grace and tender mercy;
then will the seasons of living sacrifice often return,
and an altar of praise will be dedicated to him in thy grateful heart,
and a broken heart and a contrite spirit will be more frequent
than the returning morning and the succeeding evening,
offered thereon to his great and excellent name--even to him who is fearful in praises,
glorious in holiness, doing wonders.

And in this condition if thine eye is gathered from all that was created,
and turned singly to him, thy whole tabernacle will be full of light,
even the light of the Lord Jesus Christ,
whose countenance is as the sun shining in his strength;
and in the radiance of this light, all things which are to be known of God,
as said the apostle, will be manifested in man,
and will direct thee in the way of holiness and of appointed duty; yea,
a single ray of this Divine light is a sure guide
to those whose eyes are singly directed to it.
And matter of great rejoicing it is that he who died for us,
and for our reconciliation to God while we were yet sinners,
giveth his own Divine life to us, to animate, to quicken and to make us alive unto God;
yea, how true the saying, that "`in him was life and that life was the light of men.`"

And inasmuch as that life which was in him was fraught with power,
even so to whomsoever he giveth that life he giveth power to become the children of God,
and the ability to do whatsoever he commands them.
And I feel it like a charge to thee, dear child, at this time,
that in the openings of this light, and by the pointings of this spirit,
and in the strength that he giveth, whatsoever he biddeth thee to do, that do,
however little, and low, and ignorant thou may feel thyself,
for then thy strength will not be in thyself, but in him, and if on him thou humbly wait,
and in him alone thou put thy trust, he will be both wisdom and strength,
he will be mouth and wisdom, tongue and utterance, yea, he will make hard things easy,
and bitter things sweet.

And it will be given thee to see that "`it is not in him
that walketh to direct his steps,`" in divine things;
nay, it is not in the wisest, nor most learned in man`'s wisdom,
to direct their steps aright in that way that leads to holiness,
the end whereof is everlasting life.
I know it is thy delight to turn thy mind inward and to wait upon the Lord, and I do,
my dear child, heartily commend thee, for thy love of this profitable,
and I may say this heavenly exercise,
for here in this inward court the whole soul is poured out in continual prayer or praise,
as its condition may be,
and He who plainly sees and hears all the silent language of the inner man,
will regard it.

The tendency of things in our Society seems now to be outward,
too much outward in many places,
and a disposition to avoid that flesh paining exercise of the cross of Christ,
is sorrowfully apparent, the endurance whereof was seen both by the primitive Christians,
and by our forefathers, as indispensable to the mortifying of the deeds of the body,
so essential to regeneration and consequently to salvation,
insomuch that true discipleship cannot be known and experienced without it,
as demonstrated by our Lord himself--"`except a man deny himself
and take up his cross daily he cannot be my disciple`"--the way
and the only way of coming to him the Fountain of living waters,
whereby the inner man can be sustained, refreshed, and kept alive.

Great effort has been made and is making,
great skill and ingenuity is brought into requisition by
the wise and the learned to devise an easier way to Paradise,
to hew out, to frame, and to build a cistern, or system of man`'s wisdom,
that will be a likeness or substitute for the living fountain; but alas,
for such builders, their language is and will remain to be confounded,
and they themselves will be scattered abroad to the unsettled opinions of those
who believe not in the light and life and presence of the Lord Jesus,
as their living instructor and director to the one eternal
and saving power and principle of Christian redemption,
both by the way of the cross outwardly for the remission of sins that are past,
and by the power of the cross inwardly,
"`the wisdom of God and the power of God`" to the sanctifying of the will of the flesh.

In the records of the Holy Scriptures, is to be found abundance of material for building,
and it is ever lamentable to see how ready the wise of this world,
and the learned in the schools of men are to lay
hold of these materials with unhallowed hands,
and to raise up mighty structures,
beautiful and pleasing to the unsanctified vision of man,
and to call it the temple of the Lord; but the Lord does not own it,
for "`except the Lord build the city, he laboreth in vain that buildeth it.`"
How lamentable that men of this description should have
unfurled their ensigns within the pale of this Society,
and how far more so that they should become influential and popular!

I have no doubt,
my dear child that my having omitted so long (or rather been withheld) from writing,
has been a trial to thy patience, but in wisdom, perhaps, designed to be profitable,
and I do desire that every trial permitted to reach thee, may be sanctified for good,
and prove a furtherance to every good word and work,
and perhaps for the greater joy when he, the Good Shepherd,
shall come again to speak peace and comfort to the weary soul,
for such is the experience of thy unworthy correspondent; the greater the trials,
and the deeper the provings which have been permitted to assail him,
if patiently endured, such have been the harbingers of the greater joy and peace.
Finally, my dear friend, I must with love unfeigned bid thee farewell,
with a desire to hear from thee when thou feels like writing.

[.signed-section-closing]
I am affectionately thy friend,

[.signed-section-signature]
John Wilbur.

To The Same.

[.signed-section-context-open]
Hopkinton, 9th of 3rd mo, 1841.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend M+++_______+++,

Time rolls on so rapidly, and my engagements and correspondents are so numerous,
that I am almost afraid some of my dear friends will tax me with forgetfulness and neglect;
but I desire they may make allowance for the length of time that intervenes,
after the receipt of their letters, until the answer arrives;
for truly my time is not idly passed away.
Some of my precious correspondents have to wait for an answer from three to six months,
and even some on the other side of the Atlantic, a year.
But on reading thy letter again this morning,
it seemed right for me now to set apart a few moments to tell thee how acceptable it was,
and remains to be, (for I have read it divers times,) so full was it of what was,
and remains to be, the true characteristic of discipleship, of Christianity,
even the love of God which is in Christ Jesus, coupled with meekness and humility.

These, my dear M+++_______+++, are treasures of great value in the sight of God,
and for the reason that they are derived from him,
and come from that one Fountain of everlasting goodness,
and are among the best of his gifts.
Oh! how many are the heavenly gifts which he mercifully bestows upon the faithful!
Some indeed, he bestows upon the disobedient,
but the increase thereof is in due proportion to
the faithfulness and fidelity of the receiver.
How much encouragement then, my dear, for faithfulness, for obedience,
for trusting in him, for a willingness to suffer with him,
and to endure for his great name`'s sake, and for his testimonies`' sake,
all the reproaches that man may be permitted to heap upon us, and to bear them patiently.

How good it is indeed, under the keenest and most aggravated sufferings,
to realize the injunction of Him who suffered for us, viz:
"`In patience possess ye your souls.`"
For it is in and through this abiding and increasing
patience that we can possess and enjoy our souls,
and be enabled to profit by our sufferings and afflictions.
Thus it is then, in this day of trial and conflict, wherever men`'s souls are tried,
that I greatly desire to be enabled to keep the word of God`'s patience,
his everlasting patience, so that the annexed promise may be witnessed,
"`I will keep thee in the hour of temptation.`"

Oh, then! pray for us here, my dear child,
that those who have hitherto been mercifully preserved
through the fulfillment of this blessed promise,
may be kept henceforth from denying his name, either in the things which they do,
or in the things which they allow;
that they may be furnished with wisdom to guide them aright, either in the doing,
or not doing, and strength from the inexhaustible fountain of strength,
to do that which is called for at their hands, to his honor and to his praise,
and to the upholding of his testimonies and his statutes,
even those testimonies which were so precious in the sight of God,
and the raising of them up in the world, a matter of such vast importance,
that he even deigned to give the lives of many who
were near and dear to him as the apple of his eye,
in purchase of them.

Who then will venture, in frustration of his blessed purpose,
to sacrifice even the least of these dear-bought
testimonies of his upon the altars of men?
I believe the true doctrines and testimonies of our Society are subjects of the
greatest hatred with the wicked one of anything that exists in this world;
and therefore it would seem that all the arts of deceivableness and insidiousness
in his power are brought into requisition in these our days,
for the perversion and destruction of them; and among his intrigues,
that of casting opprobrium and reproach upon those
who stand faithful to these doctrines and testimonies,
is not the least.

And it seems here in Rhode Island, as it was a few years ago in New York,
in those places where the supporters of Elias Hicks were the most numerous,
they cast upon those who withstood his views the stigma of "`disaffected,`" or
"`the disaffected party,`" and "`opposers of good order,`" and "`intruders upon
the harmony of Society;`" and all for the purpose of destroying their influence,
and the good which they might otherwise do in the
sustaining of our primitive doctrines and testimonies.
Well, my dear friend,
such has been the lot of the faithful in different ages of the world;
the most faithful to God`'s testimonies have been "`numbered
with the transgressors,`" and therefore we have no reason
to marvel that such remains to be their lot in this day,
wherein there seems to be little or no hesitation
with many in upholding those who are lightly esteeming,
if not perverting, the doctrines of Truth as ever held sacred by our Society.

Thou seems desirous of knowing whether the afflictions that
have befallen me have not been injurious to my health;
a thoughtfulness fraught with great kindness.
In answer to which I can tell thee,
that although I was considerably indisposed for most of last month
with the epidemic which has gone through this country very much,
of an affection of the chest and lungs, commonly called a cold,
yet I believe it was not the effect of the afflictions that have befallen
me in relation to the preservation of our inestimable principles.
It is true that on account of the jeopardy that seems to await them,
together with the efforts that are in operation to drive me from that post and
station which I trust the Captain of our salvation has assigned me,
that many deep sufferings from the arrows of the archers which have been aimed at me,
and sometimes pierced and caused great pain for a season, have fallen to my lot.

But blessed be the name of Him who was pierced before me, and for me, that I might live,
he has been my physician;
his coming and returning presence has been a balm to my wounded soul;
and when he has bid me live, his word has been a word of life and power to me;
and behold I yet live, yet not I, for whatsoever I have of that which makes me live,
is only and altogether from him;
and for the continuance of which I feel myself bound
under the strongest obligation to trust in him,
to serve him, and obey him, and to render unto him the praise of hitherto keeping me,
inasmuch as I am sure without the encompassing of
his power I shall never be able to endure,
or ward off the fiery darts of the wicked one.

Nor is it in him that walketh to direct his steps.
Then how needful that we should live near to the Lord, and wait on him for direction,
and call mightily on him for preservation, as well as to lie very low before him,
in great meekness and humility;
for then he will teach us of his ways and guide us
in the midst of the paths of true judgment.
Oh! for this true judgment!
Oh! for the right discrimination!
How greatly wanting amongst us in this our day! and all for want of true humility,
and getting down to the pure witness for God in the heart.

Ever since our first acquaintance, and during my tarriance at thy father`'s house,
I have felt a deep interest in thy success in the journey heavenward;
on which I was then, and am now, sure that thou hast set out,
and wast endeavoring to advance therein,
and to make straight steps with thy feet thitherward.
During our stay at thy uncle`'s that interest and living desire for thy preservation,
progress, and growth in the ever blessed Truth continued and increased;
and my prayers at the present time are for thy enlargement in that soul-sustaining,
inwardly revealed knowledge of God,
attained only through Him who is the messenger of all that is lovely, all that is holy,
of all that gives consolation, of all that gives wisdom and power,
and of all that sustains the inner man.

These, my dear child,
are mercifully given to those who seek for wisdom at the hand of God in their own hearts,
in such measure as is suited to their condition and experience;
and it is only in proportion to our faith, and the obedience of it,
that an understanding of divine things is vouchsafed.
Inasmuch then as it was through suffering that our dear Redeemer
wrought salvation for us both without us and within us,
whereby his mission was made perfect,
even so it is through the fellowship of his sufferings wrought in us,
that a preparation of heart for the enlargement of
the knowledge of divine things is made perfect;
not merely by his sufferings being imputed to us, as suffering for our sake,
but also by the endurance of deep sufferings in ourselves for his sake,
wherein only the fellowship of his sufferings is known in these earthly tabernacles.

Now, therefore,
we have no occasion to fear the want of knowing the divine mind and will concerning us;
if we patiently and faithfully abide the necessary baptisms in preparation for it,
we shall be sure to receive the necessary instructions,
even all that we are prepared to profit by.
Our way will at times be made plain before us, as we wait for him and wait upon him.

[.signed-section-closing]
I remain in the salutation of gospel love,

[.signed-section-closing]
thy very affectionate friend,

[.signed-section-signature]
John Wilbur.
