+++[+++In the early part of this painful controversy,
many Friends in different parts of the Society who took
decided ground against the innovations of Gurney and others,
and continued faithful for a season,
fellow-helpers and sympathizers with John Wilbur in his labors and trials,
afterwards yielded to the powerful influences brought to bear upon them,
and fell away from their integrity,
coming to support the very things which they had but lately testified against.
These cases were cause of deep sorrow to this true and faithful Friend,
both on account of the lamentable condition of such backsliders themselves,
and the effect which their apostasy was calculated to have upon
others regarding the precious cause he had so much at heart.
With several of these he labored both personally and by letter,
in love unfeigned but with faithfulness and truth, for their restoration;
manifesting an ardent desire for their eternal welfare,
and that they might not make shipwreck of the faith.
A few of the letters he wrote on these occasions are given in this volume,
one of which here follows.]

From J. W. to Eli And Sybil Jones.

[.signed-section-context-open]
Hopkinton, 2nd mo., 11th, 1841.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friends Eli and Sybil Jones,

I have not heard from you since you left Fall River,
but many times have I thought of you, and more especially of late,
and as I believe in that which revives a living evidence of the unity of the one Spirit,
as well as the fellowship of the gospel of Christ in the bonds whereof his messengers
can greet each other--can greet those that are in bonds as being bound with them;
and how truly great is their work of withstanding that which is evil,
and of furthering that which is good, of pulling down the kingdom of Satan,
and of building up the kingdom of Christ the Redeemer.

To be bound to such a work as this, is a solemn, and a high and holy calling,
of which I am sure you are well aware, as also that the anointing of the savor of life,
in and by that gospel, which is the power of God unto salvation,
is the appointed and only means of the exaltation
of God`'s kingdom and power successfully among men.
Wherever that is raised up,
it is and must necessarily be upon the ruins of Satan`'s empire in their hearts,
and accomplished only through contention and strife,
even to making war in righteousness against the mighty
foe wherever he may have encamped himself,
and in whatever form, or under whatever name he may be seen and detected,
even by that true light of Christ,
without which you know that his warriors and messengers will run in vain,
and instead of saving the lives of others will jeopard their own.

The stronghold and kingdom of the enemy is in the minds of men;
and although he is a distinct being, his dominion is only known in the hearts of men,
that is, in this world--in the hearts of those who receive him and serve him.
Hence when the poor warrior of Christ`'s banner makes war against him (otherwise
than in his own heart) he necessarily has a twofold contention and combat,
namely, with the enemy combined with his servants.
And more especially arduous must be the contest,
when his servants are many and leagued together;
and most of all under the dominion of a spurious religion.
The popular prevalence of such a state of things combined with power,
has undoubtedly been the hardest thing which the Lord`'s
messengers have ever had to contend with in this lower world;
a stronghold of which Satan has been wont proudly to possess himself;
and however little by little were his strides in the primitive Christian church,
yet alas how lamentably he finally succeeded in apostatizing
and corrupting that once best of all bodies,
which instead of continuing to be the spouse, the Lamb`'s wife,
degenerated into a horde of sordid, cruel oppressors, and even murderers of the faithful.

How easily might that apostasy have been arrested
at first whilst yet it had gained but little ground,
by a united stand of the church at large.
But alas! what inexpressible suffering and rivers of blood it cost,
to obtain but a partial reformation after the consummation
of the lapse of the church into formality and idolatry.
Again how the fear of man, the love of ease, and the dread of conflict and controversy,
unhappily induced the primitive Christians to jeopard
the standing and safety of the church.
Satan who had striven in vain to destroy them from without,
now resorts to a different stratagem.
Men of influence, talent and learning, having got above the pure witness in themselves,
introduced innovations by degrees within her pale, upon her pure doctrines and practices,
until at length her principles were subverted and her destiny sealed.

Is it not wonderful as well as sorrowful that the cry of these innovators of peace,
of safety and security,
should have deterred the faithful from sounding the
alarm at the insidious approach of an enemy,
and of unflinchingly making a stand against him;
for it is not altogether unlikely that there were some if not many who from time
to time saw the danger which awaited them and gave warning of it,
but were decried and made unpopular by the leaders in those innovations,
and their credulous adherents.
Herein the plausibility of the snare consisted,
and the great subtlety and power of the enemy was successful, the cry being peace, peace,
no detraction, no controversy, etc.

Now in this view and mirror of former times,
we clearly see the face of things in these our days.
The Hicksites at the West, whilst they were persistently undermining Quakerism,
were plausibly avowing their integrity,
and at the same time striving to avoid all inquiry,
and to stop the mouths of the honest by crying peace, peace, love and unity,
no detraction, no controversy.
The very same course was taken by Isaac Crewdson and his party in England,
as also by Elisha Bates, striving to impress the minds, even of honest Friends,
(and sometimes successfully,) that it was improper to speak of any apprehended danger,
lest, as they said, the peace and quiet of the Society should be disturbed,
and the good order broken.
It was seen, however,
that those plausible pretensions were but the seductions of the enemy,
because the principal movers of them had evidently departed from Friends`'
doctrine and only resorted to this artful policy to avoid detection.

Time was as above hinted,
when the grand enemy warred against the true church by his ministers from without.
This was the case both in the primitive times and
in the days of George Fox and his contemporaries;
causing great contention and controversy, at each of those periods,
though we know most in relation to the latter.
And our early Friends,
honestly and manfully met and rebutted every attack upon the true doctrines of the gospel,
in due season, and without fear of consequences.
And how are we to suppose that God`'s tender image of purity
and uprightness was preserved in them and kept alive,
amid the strife of tongues, and such a mighty controversy?

Was it not because they were covered with the armor of God?
Was it not because they accounted not their own lives dear
in coming up to the help of the Lord against the mighty?
Was it not because they walked in the light, and dwelt in the life,
and were endowed with the temper and spirit of heaven?
Was it not because the Captain of their salvation led them out and brought
them in and covered them with his unfailing power in the day of battle?
Was it not because their plain dealing with those who committed wrong upon the Truth,
was in the love of Christ, and therein extended,
as well for their recovery as for the defence of his doctrines and testimonies?

And now, my dear friends,
if such resisting of that which is evil from an enemy without the camp,
was in the will and ordering of the blessed Head of the church,
what may we suppose is his will in relation to resisting
that which is evil and dangerous within our walls?
Men, women and children were then united in making a stand
against the opposers of Truth`'s doctrines.
And inasmuch as those doctrines are as eminently valuable,
both to us and to the world now, as they were then,
is it not as needful that all of every class,
should unite heart and hand in withstanding and repelling everything which
tends to lead off and scatter from the blessed standard of life and power,
in all that is worth the name of religion.

Is the danger less to the flock,
when the wolf has attired himself with the sheep`'s clothing,
and made his way into the fold?
Is less effort requisite expelling and getting him out than to prevent his coming in?
And if God`'s testimonies and doctrines are as dear
to himself now as they were in former times,
when he gave the lives of many of his faithful children for them,
will he not extend the arm of his power for the spiritual preservation
of those who walk in his fear and trust in him in fulfilling his command,
in their allotment of watching over the flock now, as well as formerly?

We read in Acts 20:28th,
"`Take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock
over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers,
to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood; for I know this,
that after my departure shall grievous wolves enter in among you,
not sparing the flock,`" etc.
And the solemn charge to Ezekiel 3:20th,
"`When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness,
because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die,
but his blood will I require at thy hand.`"
This passage has divers times been brought home to my mind;
and if the church were substituted for the righteous man,
how vastly greater the responsibility upon him who
neglecteth or refuseth to give warning.

But this warning we know must be in the spirit and temper of the gospel,
in that love and meekness which entertaineth no personal animosity,
in that wisdom described by the apostle as being first pure, then peaceable,
etc. Why did William Penn advise Joseph Pike to read
controversy on the doctrines of Friends,
if it were not for his confirmation in them--he knew that J. P. was no superficial man,
and that he had no life in the faults and failings of others;
but he knew that to see the deformity and tendency of bad doctrines,
would be likely to enhance and confirm the excellency
of the good in that sincere and upright man.
At this day there seems to be no safety without it--to compare
all doctrines now introduced to our reading with the standard;
and for those who cannot test them with a standard within themselves--to
test them by a comparison with Barclay and other sound writers.

This letter has been written to you in the liberty of gospel freedom,
and if you have any remarks to make upon it, let them come as freely.
In the full feeling of gospel love to you both I must now say farewell,
and am your friend,

Liverpool, 5th mo., 1st, 1841.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend John Wilbur,

Though it is long since I penned anything direct to thee, yet not through forgetfulness,
nor the want of continued affectionate regard have I withheld,
but lest I should prevent my husband writing,
and so occasion thee loss instead of profit.
Thy letter of the 27th of 9th month, came safely to hand, and was truly acceptable,
as thine always are; but it furnished abundant cause for mournful reflection,
and called forth anew our sympathy with thee, our beloved friend,
in thy many and deep trials,--trials which we can, by present and past experience,
appreciate in some degree, and with little prospect at this time of any other portion.

What can my poor,
feeble pen do to sustain or comfort thee under these conflicts,--what but commend thee,
with myself, to our merciful Father, in whose cause thou art suffering?
and to assure thee of the love and continued sympathy
of many of thy friends in this land,
by whom thy labors amongst us will never be forgotten.
We communicated with George and Ann Jones on the subject of thine,
being lately at their Quarterly Meeting, and mourned together.
Our Society, in this land, is in a wonderful mixture,
and in many places a great fermentation is going on.
I should think, in most of our Quarterly Meetings,
there were members who have received the rite of water-baptism;
and such cases are not brought forward for dealing,
if they continue to attend our meetings, so far as I know,
except in one case in Yorkshire.

Many of the descendants of the old stock are thus
turning their backs and stumbling at the Cross,
which leaves many vacant places, and truly it maybe said,
that the sons of aliens become our vine-dressers.
In our country,
it is sorrowful to remark how few (hardly any) of the children of our ministers,
come forward in any way as Friends,--many up and down quite gone.
If Friends had been faithful and fearless, things would never have got to this pass;
but now, I believe, two thirds of our members are what is called Evangelical.
In the Men`'s Yearly Meeting, that party sways entirely,
and in our Select Yearly Meeting; but not so much in our Women`'s Yearly Meeting,
though much more than formerly.

I fear it will be a disappointment to thee to receive this from me,
instead of my husband, but I expect it will soon be followed by one from him,
giving thee some account of our Yearly Meeting now near at hand.
The Grosvenor-street meetinghouse, at Manchester, owned by the separatists from us there,
is offered for sale or to let, the congregation having dwindled away.
Isaac Crewdson travels up and down performing the rite of
water-baptism on such as he can persuade to receive it.
I believe most of our Friends who have submitted to it, have received it at his hands.

Anna Braithwaite said, some years ago,
that it was inexplicable to her why she was discountenanced and looked upon with distrust,
while J. J. Gurney was received and caressed by the same persons,
for their sentiments were very similar; which was a remark not easily answered.
His popularity is very great; a certain courtliness of manner,
seconded by a very liberal use of his immense wealth,
gives him great influence with the young, and with persons in limited circumstances.
His ministry has long been a burden to me, and is less satisfactory even,
since his return from your land.
His writings I have only read in part, admiring them no way;
his style is artificial and formal, and difficult to understand;
but those parts quoted in thy letter, with the help of thy annotations,
I can comprehend.

They are not in accordance with the writings of our forefathers,
nor do they meet the witness for Truth in me,--far otherwise.
At that most trying and tedious Select Yearly Meeting,
when he laid his concern to visit you before us,
the first who spoke was that valiant man, William Gundry,
who said that he ought to satisfy Friends that his sentiments
had undergone a change before he could approve his concern;
after Sarah Grubb, Ann Coning, and myself had spoken, a relative of J. J. G. said,
that the spirit that actuated our opposition was from beneath,
for which she was afterwards reproved with little effect;
altogether it was a most trying time.
It is true, I fear,
that the greater part of English Friends are like those thou speaks of in New England,
(and they are the most influential class,) "`changing the ground of our
primitive doctrines,`" yet there are many up and down who faithfully adhere
in principle and practice to our old standards as displayed by Fox,
Penn, and Barclay.
With these, as way opens, we shall confer.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

Although I have taken no notice hitherto, on this sheet,
of thy repeated conflicts with thy committees at Greenwich,
it is not because I am indifferent about it.
No, my dear friend, not in the least;
for my heart is full of sympathy with thee in thy sufferings; at any rate,
it is as full as my very small, and, I often think,
decreasing capacity for feeling will admit;
for I do have to tread myself in very low places, and as to any more enlargement,
I am ready to conclude the day and time for it is passed over,
so that my prison will prove my grave.

But I do believe, that the victory will be given thee over all thine enemies,
even by him who hath hitherto covered thy head in the day of battle,
and on every successive engagement,
so that they have not been permitted to hurt a single hair;
for "`how should one be enabled to chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight,
except their Rock had sold them, and the Lord had shut them up?`"
I am persuaded that they now are even ready to call upon the rocks to cover them,
to hide their shame, for they are at their wits`' end!
They know not what to do; and I should not be at all surprised,
if they should be themselves caught in the very net which they have laid for thee.

And thou hadst a renewed opportunity at Greenwich to see how He who hath called,
qualified and sent thee, as he did one formerly, unto a captivated people,
in a "`land of darkness,`" to lead them forth,
that they may serve him according to his will, and not Pharaoh`'s,--I say,
thou hadst renewed evidence of his providential care,
in that He stood between thee and thy pursuers, as in a cloud, which, doubtless,
gave thee light, but was darkness unto them.
And how they were troubled by it!
And were not their chariot-wheels smitten off, so that they drave them heavily?

Thy account of it did seem wonderful to me, and not to me alone.
Oh, that silence, which succeeded the reading of thy letter!
I thought it might truly have been said, "`Marvellous things did he +++[+++as]
in the land of Egypt, +++[+++as]
in the field of Zoan.`"
And never fear, my dear friend, for he who has been with thee in six troubles,
will not desert thee in the seventh!
But it was not till Egypt had been smitten with all his wonders,
that they let the people go formerly;
and it is not for thyself alone that they are suffered to pursue thee so sharply;
the Lord will doubtless be honored by it, and his glorious cause advanced;
generations unborn will hear of these things, and speak of them,
and rank them among his wonderful works.

Reigate, Surrey, 6th mo., 21st, 1841.

Ah! my dear friend, it is so cheering and strengthening to hear from thee;
it seems to give one a little lift amid the trials of the day,
although thy account was indeed a mournful one;--how painful,
that those who are leaders of the people, and should be patterns of good things,
should show that such a wrong spirit is ruling in them!
I do, indeed,
very tenderly sympathize with thee under such suffering as thou must go through,
and one`'s heart seemed filled with praise and admiration
of that divine Power who enables his humble,
faithful servants and children to wax valiant in fight,
and preserves them in the meekness of true wisdom;
and I do trust thou wilt be supported to the end through all that may be permitted
to come upon thee in the unflinching "`defence of the gospel.`"

When I last heard from Sarah L. Grubb,
she particularly wished her tender sympathy and love
in the "`unchangeable Truth`" to thee.
But I must copy what she says, for it is thy due.
I had sent her thy kind letter to read, which, she says,
"`is very confirming as to my own views of the present state of things amongst us.
I am truly glad to find that dear J. W. has maintained his ground so nobly.
I had thought much of him for a considerable time past, and wished to know,
were it possible that one so eminently chosen for advocating Truth`'s
testimonies could be turned at all aside by fair appearances;
for there is something in this day like the chameleon change of color.
Was there, indeed,
ever a time when the grand adversary showed himself
in his various transformations as now?
Ah! we had need be endued with that wisdom that is of an opposite character from his,
'`the crooked serpent,`' even what comes '`from above,`' which,
while it is gentle and easy to be entreated, gives true discernment,
and penetrates the false coverings, however gilded and calculated to deceive.
Well, my dear friend, we are yet favored to see a few overcomers,
who are made pillars in the temple, hewn out and established by an almighty,
all-skilful Hand,--what a mercy!
Yes, '`wisdom hath builded her house,
she hath hewn out her pillars.`' Our beloved brother could not have been one
of these any other way than by entire passiveness to the power working in him,
both to will and to do of the good pleasure of Him whose understanding is infinite, and,
therefore, not to be comprehended by that which is finite It is my humble trust,
that the great Head of the church will yet separate more manifestly,
'`that which doth serve him,
from that which serveth him not,`' even '`the precious from the vile,`' to his own glory,--bringing
the righteous to shine forth as the light in the kingdom of their Father,
evidencing that they are truly under His government,
whose right it is to sway his sceptre in the hearts of the children of men,
and whose dominion is forever and ever.
Amen.`"

I remain thy nearly united and affectionate friend,

[.salutation]
My Dear Thomas,

Thy very acceptable letter came to hand in due course;
but I still remain unable to do much by way of a paper correspondence,
but will just say that my fractured limb appears
to be doing as well as can be expected for the time.
It appears that the bones have become united,
though they have not yet acquired much strength.
I find no cause at all to complain of my lot,
fully believing that my confinement will prove profitable to me;
having always found that whatsoever tends to reduce and humble the natural mind,
if patiently endured, and received as ordered or permitted by God, proves profitable,
as it may and does contribute to deepen my hold on him.

And truly, much room there was and still is,
in the great profundity of his power and wisdom,
for me to get down through all that is movable or changeable,
to the everlasting Rock whereon alone there is perfect safety;
from whence neither the sorrow of friends,
nor rejoicing of enemies can move the feet of those who stand fast thereon.
Nor need the blowing of the wind or vehement beating of the storm,
be any discouragement to these,
although the blindness of man may deem such provings to have been
the fruits of God`'s displeasure and indignation.

But I know not, my dear Thomas,
that the exigencies of the true church in the days of its greatest perils,
ever required clearer vision,
or that its standard-bearers should be more livingly
prepared by the baptism of Christ`'s sufferings,
than at this very memorable time!
No matter how much evil may be said of them (without cause) for his sake,
and for his cause`'s sake,
if they are deeply grounded in that blessed Truth which changeth not;
then they shall stand and the cause shall prosper in their hands--no
matter how adverse the winds nor how frequently they change,
if these have good ground and are furnished with the sure anchor of God`'s Providence.

I have not yet been off the bed, but hope I shall be able to do so in a week more,
but great caution will be necessary.

I that which I trust changeth not.

I am thy friend,

Hopkinton.
12th mo., 14th, 1841.

The transactions, as thou wilt have heard, respecting Mary Davis and Isaac Mitchell,
seem to have been perfectly in accordance with Gurneyism,
and no worse than we had reason to expect,
now so near as we are approximating towards the consummation of our troubles;
the endurance whereof is certainly not joyous, but grievous;
and only as they are borne in true Christian patience it is,
that these afflictions will contribute to an exceeding and eternal weight of glory;
of which things I do not speak with the least apprehension that they are unknown to thee,
my dear fellow-sufferer, but as being well known and appreciated.

But truly, if we might be favored to escape with our lives,
until the Lord of Sabaoth shall be pleased to say it is enough,
how then shall we rejoice in his salvation.
But at the same time, though it be but human, the prayer can hardly be forborne,
that the Lord Almighty would hasten the time of our deliverance,
and that not for ourselves alone, but for others, lest faith, both theirs and ours,
should not endure the test of a sore and perilous and protracted warfare!

Nay, but however good it is to look forward,
and to see things clearly that are coming and must come,
yet as to the endurance of labor and affliction,
our prayer for ability must be day by day; and then we shall find,
that the evil is not only sufficient for the day, but the day sufficient for the evil;
and now and then a little time to spare,
for the renewal of our hope in the arm of God`'s salvation.
Oh! then, seeing the promise rests upon this one thing,
"`to them who love God shall all things work together for good,`" let us gather unto him,
and sink down into the ocean of his love!
And then, though the voice of the enemy may roar tremendously,
and a flood may be poured forth out of his mouth after the woman,
yet our dwelling will be in safety and out of his reach,
because love is an element in which the Dragon cannot live; because God is love,
unto whom he cannot come.

But with what language shall we describe the condition and enjoyment of the little,
humble, faithful followers of a crucified Saviour?
Their communion is with him and with one another; and when they come together,
and can speak one to another, as they desire often to do, what joy, what salutations,
what tender embraces!
And He who is Lord over all, delighteth in the pure love of his children,
to himself and to one another.
What a brave thing then, to be happily numbered with those who serve him,
through all those perils which the apostle enumerates,
or so many of them as the Lord in wisdom shall permit,
for the full proof of their loyalty and fidelity!

It has fallen to my lot of late,
to attend several funerals with those unconnected with Friends;
a service in which life and power, tongue and utterance, were mercifully vouchsafed.
May the Lord only have the praise!

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend, Mary Davis,

It is now more than six weeks since I received the injury,
and consequently since I have been abroad to any other house,
but my fractured limb has succeeded and improved, I believe,
quite as well as is common for a person of my age; I am about, both within doors and out,
with my crutches,
but dare not venture to bear enough weight on my weak leg to go without them yet.
But I have some thought of trying to get to meeting next first day.
This comparatively light affliction and privation has, I trust,
not been unprofitable to me.

All our trials, if patiently endured with perfect submission,
contribute to our further experience in best things,
and to an increased purification of heart,
preparatory for a greater enjoyment of peace and consolation,
as well as for the service of our divine Lord and Master among his people.
For the sons of Levi were to be purified more than any other of the Lord`'s people,
in order to be fitted for that sacred calling of administering
holy things--were to be purged as gold and as silver,
and to stand on the bottom of Jordan until the people were clean passed over,
that stones of memorial might be brought up,
thereby furnishing evidence that they were divinely
called and qualified for the priest`'s office;
so now his living ministers have to be purified more than others,
have often to be chosen in the furnace of affliction, and to go down into Jordan,
the river of judgment, bringing up from thence living stones of memorial;
thus evidencing that they are the Lord`'s own purified and baptized messengers,
not only to publish glad tidings, and to preach the acceptable year of the Lord,
but to wage war in righteousness against all that believeth and maketh a lie; and,
in short, against all the enemies of God`'s heritage;
and oh! what a great want there is up and down among those who
are called the Lord`'s people of abiding in the furnace of affliction,
to the perfect renovation of all their mental faculties and perceptions.

If this is not in some good degree the case, thou knowest, my dear friend,
none can see things as they are in the visions of light,
none can distinguish between the radiance of the fallen angel,
and that of the angels of God, between the precious and the vile,
between that which serveth God and that which serveth him not.
How important then in this our day,
whilst he who can so dissemble as to be a lying spirit in the mouth of the prophets,
and "`prevail`" to induce the hosts of Israel to go to Ramoth Gilead,
the land of slaughter, that we endure the needful purgations!

But may we not console ourselves a little, my dear friend, in believing,
however forlorn the condition of the Lord`'s people in this day,
that there are more true prophets left us and more clear vision than in Micaiah`'s time,
when there was but one to four hundred among the prophets
who saw things clearly in the pure visions of light?
When I was in our Yearly Meeting where there was probably about four hundred present,
the thought was introduced to my mind that the proportion was much greater who
would advise against going to Ramoth Gilead than in Ahab`'s collection of prophets;
yet this little number of true prophets, were they not often smitten as Micaiah was,
and tauntingly inquired of in substance,
"`Which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me to thee,`" and
were not the horns of iron also seen in the hands of some?

Thomas and Elizabeth Robson came here while I was a bed-keeper,
even very soon after the accident;
and their whole business was to exhort and command me to
condemn my speaking so freely against J. J. Gurney.
They came directly from Providence by the way of T. Rowland`'s,
and seemed to be very highly charged;
telling me that if I did not retract I should have no peace of mind!
But I thought I had a better knowledge for myself of what would make for peace,
than they had for me;
for truly I have seldom found more satisfaction in an adherence to what I believed
to be the intimations of Truth than in a consistent refusal to condemn,
in any way whatever,
the course which I have taken in relation to J. J. G. and his doctrines.

Since then I have received a long letter from T. Howland for the same purpose,
containing nothing but old, worn-out and absurd arguments, allegations and exhortations.
A recantation from me would no doubt greatly contribute
to the interest and success of their cause;
hence they seem disposed not to leave a stone unturned,
or any effort untried by which they might have any hope of effecting that object.
I apprehend they are sensible that a recantation from me would do vastly more
for their cause than any disciplinary proceedings which they could adopt,
even if they were able to excommunicate me from the Society.

The greater and more repeated their efforts for such a purpose,
the more settled I am in the opinion that they are determined to
adopt the doctrines of Gurney instead of those of our forefathers;
and therefore the more unalterable I am in the resolution
never to make the required recantation come what may.
And truly, my dear friend, since I have now been confined,
I have felt more easy and quiet than ever as to the
result of their proceedings towards me,
feeling well satisfied in committing the whole cause
to Him who will suffer nothing to befall me,
as I trust, but will tend to my good, the good of his cause, and to his glory in the end;
and I am mercifully spared from feeling any anxiety about it;
and so I hope will be my friends everywhere in relation
to my sufferings and persecutions.

He who rules in the kingdoms of men, will finally order and control all things aright,
if we simply do that which he calleth for at our hands in the opening of his will to us,
and patiently wait, and quietly hope for his salvation;
and if he appoint unto us greater afflictions than we have yet
experienced if we are favored to keep "`the word of his patience
"`he will not leave us nor forsake us in the day of trouble,
but will succor and sustain us through all that men can do to us,
and he will preside over and order his own cause, and finally give us the victory.
My wife and family join me in much dear love to thyself, husband and family,
and to all our dear faithful Friends in your quarter.

Farewell.

My Dear And Much Esteemed Friend, John Wilbur,

I have long wished for a little feeling of ability to give
thee a written proof of my sisterly sympathy with thee,
in and under the protracted suffering which has fallen to thy lot,
for thy faithfulness in supporting the doctrines, the principles,
and testimonies given to our dear forefathers, and to us as their representatives,
to bear to the world.
Many things have conspired to prevent and to discourage me from putting my wish in practice;
one of the principal of which is an increased and
increasing aversion to the employment of letter-writing,
from advancing age disqualifying me from doing it to my own satisfaction.

"`Many are the afflictions of the righteous,
but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.`"
I believe the present is a day in which the language
of the apostle is fulfilled in a remarkable manner,
in the experience of those who have love enough for the
great Master to stand upright and faithful unto him.
"`All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution;`" how far
the subsequent part of the sentence applies is perhaps not for me to say,
but truly those who would follow their crucified Lord faithfully,
must not only be willing to give up their names to reproach,
but their backs to the smiter, and their cheeks to them that pluck off the hair.

I doubt not but thou hast often felt the force of the language,
"`The ploughers ploughed upon my back, they made long their furrows.`"
I well remember how feelingly and forcibly this sentence dwell upon my mind,
in the beginning of the contest with that evil heart
of unbelief in departing from the living God,
in which I was engaged, however unworthily,
in your land,--and although the spirit that has risen up
in opposition to it makes high professions of love to him,
and faith in his name, I am often ready to fear for those who have imbibed it,
that they will in the end find themselves in the
condition of Absalom when he had usurped the authority,
stolen the hearts of the people from their true and lawful king,
and at last was caught by that in which he had prided himself.

It seems as though little could be done here at present,
but to endeavor to suffer patiently,
until the Lord sees meet to make a way for the deliverance of his own oppressed seed.
There are comparatively few amongst us, who see things in the true light,
few indeed who are willing to see the weak, mixed and muddy state we are in,
drinking of the muddy streams of Babylon instead of coming
to the pure River of the water of life--"`half Jew,
and half Ashdod`"--afraid to come to the true touchstone,
lest their deeds should be reproved, their false rest broken up,
their false covering rent off;
and thus the pure principles and testimonies of Truth are too strait, too narrow,
for their liberal spirits--poor, vain, self-conceited mortals,
not able to discern the true liberty, the true enlargement of soul which the Truth,
the pure Truth,
the ever blessed and unchangeable Truth gives and leads into--through
the strait gate and narrow way--the way which leads to the blessed
and glorious liberty of the children of God.

May patience have its perfect work,
and may the faith once delivered to the saints be
steadily maintained and boldly contended for,
when its blessed author leads into the field--the armor kept on in brightness,
waiting the word of command to go forth, or to stand still, then we have nothing to fear.
Farewell in the Lord.

I am as ever, thy affectionately interested friend,

Ann Jones.

Hopkinton, 15th of 2nd mo., 1842.

My Dear Thomas,

+++[+++After narrating the proceedings of the committee
in the Select Quarterly Meeting at Providence,
he says,]
I sent an address to the Meeting for Sufferings that afternoon, signed only by myself,
with extracts from the writings of J. J. G. which are deemed
to be irreconcilable with the doctrines of Friends,
desiring them to examine these and others of the same description by whomsoever written,
and to decide touching their soundness,
and lay the result of their labors and decisions before the Society in New England;
with the expression of a hope, that if rightly done,
it would contribute to the safety of the Society,
as well as to the restoration of peace among us.
This address, I was informed,
was referred for examination to a committee of six or seven,
but not to report to that sitting,
according to the heretofore invariable usage of Friends,
but to their meeting three months hence!

A similar address, 1 have since learned, was sent from Nantucket,
signed by fifteen Friends, and probably disposed of in the same manner.
But does not the jeopardy and danger which awaits the Society
by means of the spread of these baneful doctrines,
demand a speedy attention to them?
Of sufficient importance, in sounder days, would this subject have been deemed,
to have detained the Meeting for Sufferings from day to day,
until all the spurious doctrines purporting to be the doctrines of Friends,
should have received the reprobation which they deserved.
Isaac Mitchell, +++[+++of Nantucket,]
has informed me that all their ministers, elders, and overseers were called together,
when the extracts and proposed address to the Meeting for Sufferings were read,
and united with, and the address was signed by every male present,
and approbated by every female, and so certified on the back.
I am well assured of the correctness of these applications,
it being the very course contemplated by our discipline.

I hope some of you will continue to write,
but take due care not to let anything escape you to me, like flattering the creature;
for certainly there is no praise due to man,
nor to the sons of men whose breath is in their nostrils.
Those who are in this sad defection of principle,
are remarkable for giving and receiving honor one of another,
whilst they have not that which comes from God only.
Quite a different thing from the expression of unity and fellowship among brethren,
and of that encouragement and commendation which the Truth not only allows, but,
under circumstances of trial and discouragement, dictates.

In love to thyself and the whole family, with all our friends there, I conclude,
and remain thy friend,

Fall River, 15th of 3rd mo., 1842.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friends,

I have often thought of you since your Quarterly Meeting in the 12th month,
and in my little measure have sympathized with you,
and have desired and do desire that the afflictions that have been
permitted to fall to your lot from the hand of man,
may not only be endured for the sake of Him who hath called,
in the meekness and in the everlasting patience,
but may be even turned into blessings by Him who is able by his
marvellous power to cause the wrath of man to praise him,
or that the effects thereof upon the hearts of his dedicated servants
and handmaidens should contribute to their still greater depth in the
river of his power that flows from the threshold of the Sanctuary,
and finally terminates in his glory,
which is truly the consummation of every desire that
breathes in the boundless ocean of his love,
of his life, and of his power.

It does indeed appear that such a day has dawned again upon us,
as the apostle describes wherein all those who would
live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution,
wherein all who would exalt the living above the dead must endure not only the reproaches
of the world but the reproaches of those who have dipped in the same dish with them,--truly
hard to endure that such should have lifted up their heel against us.
Well my dearly beloved friends, He who trod the thorny path before us,
said to a dignified and faithful servant of the primitive age,
"`My grace is sufficient for thee;`" and if this heavenly gift
was sufficient to enable those primitive sufferers to endure that
great fight of afflictions which fell to their lot,
will it not prove abundantly sufficient in this our
day for all those who put their trust in him?
I believe it will, be their sufferings and afflictions what they may.

Although I have not been without many trials since I last
had the pleasure of enjoying your company at this place,
yet bound I am under the strongest obligations to
the God and Father of all our sure mercies,
in that he has not forsaken nor left me in the hour of trial,
and therefore desire in deep gratitude and great
humility to give thanks to his great and holy Name,
and increasingly to dedicate my all to him and to his cause,
as well as increasingly to watch,
to abide a faithful sentinel as well by night as by day, that so the grand enemy,
in whatever form or appearance he may approach me,
or the house and heritage of my fathers, may be discovered,
identified and repulsed through the power of him, who never did since the world began,
forsake nor fail to deliver his trustful, lowly-walking and faithful children;
anointing their eyes to see and distinguish the most
insidious and ensnaring wiles of the great deceiver.
But for his oft and adorable interposition,
I may well say I never should have been able to abide the trials of my day.

After all, my dear friends, I desire that our trust may be always,
and altogether in the arm of God`'s power and providence,
as it relates to our deliverance from the hands of the oppressors;
for truly there can be nothing short of such interference
whereby we have a right to expect it.

In much love to yourselves and family as well as to all faithful Friends, I conclude,
and am as ever in the fellowship of the everlasting gospel your friend,

John Wilbur.

From Lydia A. Barclay to J. W.

Reigate, 24th of 6th mo.. 1842.

My Dear Friend,

Thy last acceptable letter I received about the end of fourth mo.,
and was pleased to find by it that thy health was in great measure restored,
though of course in some degree still feeling the
effects of thy indisposition and accident last summer.
Every succeeding year of our lives,
(especially at thy advanced age,) we feel less ability
to rally after illness of any kind;
but I feel it no small favor that a few faithful watchers,
are still preserved awhile longer to our poor, degenerate church; and earnestly desire,
if consistent with the Divine will, it may be so for some years,
though I would not desire the increase of thy sufferings.

Ah! my dear friend, I could not but notice thy remark in allusion to a crisis,
if things are pursued to extremities; it must be so, one would think,
provided your other Yearly Meetings are preserved sound, but here I see no such remedy.
I trust many of us would be willing to suffer disownment and even death,
for the sake of the precious cause and testimonies of Truth,
if we may but be preserved firm thereto, faithful, humble and watchful to the very end!
Oh! how does all that is alive and sensible within me earnestly desire this,
though at times greatly bowed down under a sense of our adulterated state,
so as to long with the mournful prophet formerly for "`a lodging in the wilderness`"
that one might go from one`'s people and weep bitterly for them.

Oh, how strikingly applicable to us, as a people, are those parts of Isaiah, Jeremiah,
and Ezekiel which are addressed to backsliding Israel formerly!
And is there not danger of the language going forth, "`Shall I not visit for these things?
Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?`"
And yet when the Lord is evidently calling us to weeping and mourning
and girding with sackcloth for the backsliding and adultery amongst us,
yea, for the abominations committed by the elders of Israel,
"`behold joy and gladness;`" a boasting of good times and things amongst us,
and a saying like some of old, '``' Is not the Lord among us?
None evil can come upon us!`"
And it was said to such, "`Therefore shall Zion for your sakes be ploughed as a field,
and Jerusalem shall become heaps.`"

And yet, I am reminded whilst writing, of what my dear brother John says in a letter,
(see page 274 of the selections from his papers,
etc.,) "`However we may be permitted to be trampled upon and broken to pieces,
the blessed Truth will outlive it all, and emerge out of the very ruins,
if it must come to that!`"
Oh, this is encouraging to the poor oppressed and grieved one,
even the consideration that the Lamb and his followers shall have the victory,
the Truth shall prevail and reign over all!
Oh! then,
may we "`rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him,`"
for in due time he will come and will not tarry,
and his arising will be the scattering of his enemies,
and those that hate him shall flee before him,
however they may have made a boast of him and been leaning falsely upon him!

Our Yearly Meeting was indeed a painful time; it was considered by some,
the most quiet and harmonious we have had for some years;
but a remnant felt that it was like the quietness of death,
and the harmony of oppression, and, as such,
thought it was much more painful than when there were more open contests a few years ago.
I want much to know how thou likes the selections from dear John`'s letters, etc.
My brother Rawlinson sent thee one early in the year.
I saw a letter to him, (received lately,) from Thomas Evans of Philadelphia;
it is a poor weak thing;
and he cavils at these selections in regard to two letters at page 130,
also at another at p. 44, 45,
fearing it might discourage parents from bringing up their children consistently.
I fear he is not so wholly come round to ancient views as could be wished.

I remain thy truly sympathizing and nearly united friend,

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

It is a favor in the midst of all trials when we can look upon Zion,
the city of the saints solemnities, and to know Jerusalem to be a quiet habitation.
O,
to abide here how sweet it is! and how safe we are! even though
the blast of the terrible ones be as a storm against the wall,
or come upon us as an overwhelming flood;
yet when we have sought the Lord and his strength, has he not at times undertaken for us,
and been pleased to realize his gracious promise, in lifting up his blessed Spirit,
as a standard against them?
For he has in every age been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy,
in his distress, a refuge from the storm and the tempest.

Many are the trials and discouragements of the present day in this land,
as well as in yours; a small remnant seems left who are not, less or more,
tinctured with Beaconism;
what are called middle men--that thou need not be
surprised if the ministry be much affected.
Those who adhere closely to the first principles are not very popular at this day,
but I am thankful in believing the Almighty has, and still is,
laying his hand upon one here, and another there,
and bringing them to embrace the precious principles of our worthy predecessors,
in their purity and simplicity; particularly amongst the young men,
two of whom I had an opportunity with at my quarters in London before I left the South.
They appear to have entered into the Society by Christ the door,
who has declared himself to be the way, the truth, and the life;
hence we may consolingly believe that these and such as these,
or their children in days to come, may stand and feed the flocks,
may also help to "`build the old waste places,
and raise up the foundations of many generations.`"

Surely in this we may rejoice, that the foundation of God is the same that ever it was;
it standeth sure, and those who are building upon it, will not be confounded.
May we have the eye turned to this stronghold,
instead of looking too much to the discouragements that abound,
and thus be weakened and depressed in a way not designed
by Him whose immutable word and truth will stand,
though all men forsake it.
Still,
I believe the Lord calls many of his dear children to mourning
and lamentation because of the desolations of Zion,
yea, and gives them to be skilful therein.
It was so with our late dear Mother in Israel, and valiant in the Truth, Sarah Grubb.
Oh, how I do miss her at the Yearly Meetings!

We have not another S. G. left.
I have been comforted since her decease in the reperusal of her letters to me.
I will here give thee an extract from one of them.
"`Some of us see the necessity of being ranged conspicuously
on the side of primitive Quakerism,
and warning faithfully of the danger of things creeping in,
that from their nature and tendency must divide, must indeed separate,
whether there be an outwardly drawing the line of division yea or nay.
In fulfilling the will of our heavenly Father, we must endeavor to leave consequences,
and run the risk of being ourselves wounded by the arrows of the archers,
and perhaps even carry the marks of our engagements with us,
like scars from head to foot, to be seen to the end of our days.`"
She was often wounded in the day of battle, yet she turned not her back,
"`the arms of her hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob.`"

In the renewed feeling of that love which reaches over sea and land,
do I salute thee and bid thee farewell in the Lord.

[.salutation]
My Dear Afflicted Friend,

Thou hast been very much the companion of my mind,
not only during the months that have passed in the present eventful year,
but also at other times frequently since it was thy
lot to be a sorrowful sojourner amongst us,
in this highly professing country.
Recent accounts received confirm the apprehension of my mind,
that thou art not only set for the defence of the gospel,
but also that thou art set as a mark for the arrows of the archers.
But "`be of good cheer,`" remember the blessing pronounced by thy dear and divine
Lord and Master upon those who are persecuted for righteousness`' sake,
in the 10th, 11th, and 12th verses of the fifth chapter of Matthew;
and although there may be and doubtless are, seasons permitted,
when faith and patience are closely put to the test, yet He on whom thou believest,
and in whose cause thou art given up to suffer,
will not fail nor forsake thee in the time of need;
as surely as he was with his faithful Daniel in the lion`'s den,
and with the three children in the fiery furnace, so surely will he be near to thee.
And though thy accusers may seem to triumph, and to gain the victory for a time,
even as theirs did,
yet as thy sole trust and confidence remain to be in the name of the Lord,
he will in his own good time arise for the help of his poor afflicted children.

"`The rod of the wicked shall not rest on the lot of the righteous,
lest he also put forth his hand to do evil.`"
Nay, verily;
I believe that thy accusers have the same testimony in their hearts that Daniel`'s had,--"`we
shall find no occasion against this Daniel except it be concerning the law of his God.`"
And how marvellously did he work for Daniel`'s deliverance
and exaltation before the people.
And whether He with whom is the power,
see meet thus to deliver thee by a high hand and outstretched arm or not,
he will surely keep thee from the fear of evil, as thou continuest to trust in him.
He will not give his glory to another nor his praise to graven images,
the work of men`'s hands.
He will in his own good time deliver his oppressed seed,
will cause Jacob to rejoice and Israel to be glad.
Then fear not worm Jacob--who art thou that thou
shouldt be afraid of a man that shall die,
and of the son of man that shall be made as grass.
He who "`hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm,
and the clouds are the dust of his feet,`" will overrule all the devices and contrivances
of designing men to their confusion and the exaltation of his own precious cause,
the glory of his own glorious, holy, and ever worthy name.

George Crosfield has sent me the account of proceedings against thee,
and I have also received several letters from our dear friends in Philadelphia giving
a relation of the persecution that is carrying on against the faithful in New England.
This thou knowest, my dear friend, is nothing new,
it is the old spirit in a different form and garb;
and so far am I from believing that these things will lay
waste the precious testimonies and standard of Truth,
that I believe, however some who have seemed to be something may fall away,
the eyes and spiritual understanding of others will be opened to see further
and more clearly into the mystery of iniquity that now worketh,
and also in due time into the mystery of true godliness--the
spirituality of the gospel dispensation.

Here it is a time of suffering and oppression;
the ways of Zion mourn because so few come to her solemn feasts.
The remnant of the captivity is in much affliction and reproach,
whilst those who are seeking and striving to reign
as kings over them vaunt themselves not a little;
and some who in days past saw the desolation that was coming,
have deserted the little suffering band,
and joined themselves to those who have set up a separate altar,
and though still having power and influence, are but half Jew and half Ashdod.
Things are in a deplorable way at Bristol; indeed,
in looking over this poor Society from one end of the land to the other,
it may be truly said to be as in a day when a standard-bearer fainteth.

Dear Sarah Grubb`'s prophecies are fulfilling in a remarkable manner,
and I doubt not her persevering faithfulness to the end,
will afford lasting comfort and encouragement to many a little, hidden,
suffering disciple of the blessed Master.
With what clearness, authority, and power,
did she declare at the close of one of our women`'s Yearly Meetings,
"`The testimonies and standard of Truth will not be permitted to fall to the ground,
friends;`" and after speaking of great scattering
and desolation that was coming upon the Society,
she continued, "`there will be a little, living,
suffering remnant preserved to support them,
and after they have suffered awhile there will be a flocking to this standard, etc.`"

I believe the Society will be sifted both in your country and this,
but the wheat will be preserved--kept safe as in the heavenly garner;
as Sarah Grubb said,
"`not one grain of wheat will be lost,`" and although
the faithful ones may be cast out of the synagogue,
and their names cast out as evil doers,
these may take courage in the remembrance of their
dear Lord suffering for them without the camp.
This is a day of trouble, of treading down and of perplexity,
but there is great encouragement in remembering and in reading the accounts
we have of the patient endurance of our dear early Friends,
their steady faithful perseverance in the maintenance of
the precious testimonies given to them to bear.

Then "`fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer,`" "`when one member suffers,
all the members suffer with it,`" thou hast the very tender sympathy and
precious unity of the true disciples and children of thy dear Lord.
And should it be permitted, even that the Monthly Meeting should be nominally laid down,
it is not in the power of man to separate one living member from
the true church any more than it is in the power of finite man
to make himself or another a living member of the body of Christ.
There is great encouragement in reading dear William Leddra`'s
sweet letter written just before he was executed;
also Isaac Penington`'s description of mystery Babylon.

Doubtless thou art aware of the great stripping we have had in the removal
of some of the valiant ones who loved not their lives unto the death;
my precious husband who was for many years a mark for the arrows of the
archers being one of those;--many are the afflictions of the righteous,
but the Lord delivereth him out of them all;
he rests from his labors and his works follow him.
Oh! how many times have I been instructed and comforted in the revival of this language,
"`The righteous are taken from the evil to come;`"
and whilst feeling desolate and afflicted myself,
the sweet evidence graciously afforded, whenever sorrow comes over me like a flood,
that his pure redeemed spirit rests in the arms of everlasting mercy,
wipes away the tear,
and brings over the tribulated spirit the feeling of thanksgiving and praise.
Many times whilst writing this a saying of dear Daniel Wheeler has occurred to me,
when on board the "`Henry Freeling,`" lying off the Mother Bank,
and suffering from the same spirit; on an expression of sympathy from a friend, he said,
"`The sun can shine in the inquisition;`" and thus, dear friend, thou hast found it.

I am and I trust sincerely in the bonds and afflictions
of the gospel of Christ thy tribulated friend and sister,

Liverpool, 10 mo., 31st, 1842.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

Thy deeply interesting letter of 8th mo., 23rd,
came to my hands safely on the morning of the 15th of 9th month,
and it came most opportunely; it was the day of our Quarterly Meeting,
and its arrival enabled me to relieve the anxiety of some of thy friends;
and a great relief it was to the minds of myself and wife.
The evening before, at the close of the Select Meeting,
Susanna Haworth spoke to me of thee, expressive of much regard and sympathy,
inquiring if I had lately heard of, or from thee; on my replying in the negative,
she said she had heard,
and Lydia Neild had also heard that thy persecutors had so far prevailed,
that they had succeeded in causing thee to be disunited from the Society.

This intelligence affected us much--that thy enemies should
thus have succeeded in their unjust treatment of thee;
and in their perversion of all right, and all sound discipline.
Knowing what lengths of injustice had at times taken place,
we were the more led to fear that this might be true.
Judge then, my dear friend, of our relief and joy the next morning when thy letter came;
for, although we deeply feel and deplore the very close trials that have befallen thee,
yet to know that they had been restrained,
and not permitted to carry out their designs to the extent we had heard,
was cause of thankfulness to us;
and I took care to let the above-named two Friends know
before meeting that what they had heard was not true;
which was a great relief to them also.

In the course of that day I submitted the letter to S. Haworth, and to R. and L. Neild,
with liberty to extract the report to South Kingston Monthly Meeting, but that only.
I next sent the letter to H. and E. Hunt; from them it came safely back again,
with their thanks to me and the expression of much sympathy for thee.
I hope they have written to thee.
Excepting Ann Jones, these are all who have seen the whole letter,
as we desire to exercise proper discretion with it,
yet to use when suitable opportunity offers,
for removing the erroneous reports and impressions which have been spread on this subject.
How the report above named originated, I know not,
unless it was that they felt so sure of being able
to accomplish their designs against thee,
that they spread the report in anticipation.

But we have deemed it desirable, in order to counteract these false reports,
to communicate a copy of the report to the Monthly Meeting here, and there.
My wife sent it to M. J. Lecky, with a few remarks.
We thought this desirable, as A. A. Jenkins,
seemed to have great place with Friends at the Yearly Meeting at Dublin,
who were apparently much taken with her.
Today I received from Croudson Tunstall a letter, in which he says:
"`I attended our Monthly Meeting at Stockport last week,
where I heard from Ann Jones something more than
I previously knew of John Wilbur`'s trials,
and much I sympathize with him therein;
at the same time I have no doubt but the Master whom he serves,
as he adheres strictly to his requirings,
will bring him through the phalanx of opposition with honor.`"

Be assured, that thou hast in this land many friends,
who unite in this feeling of sympathy,
who earnestly crave and pray for thy support under these trials and persecutions,
and are thankful for the peace and composure granted thee now,
after coming out of such deep exercises and trials.
This feeling in thy own mind, is an evidence of the justness of thy cause,
and of the immutable truth of those principles which thou hast
thus upheld against those who would pull down and change them,
and also of thy feet being established on the immutable Rock,
where thou wilt witness preservation.

Surely, those who have thus tried and buffeted thee, will let the past suffice;
they ought to do so, and both they and others ought to be convinced,
and to acknowledge that thy meek and patient suffering demonstrates that it is for Christ`'s
sake and the gospel`'s that thou art enabled so patiently to bear their persecutions;
and if they should renew them,
it will perhaps tend to open the eyes of some to see the tendency of certain doctrines,
and of the declensions coming in amongst us,
which hitherto they have been unwilling to see or to acknowledge.
Should this be the result, it will be a reward to thee here,
and if this is not permitted thee, the reward is sure hereafter,
for it is promised in that everlasting kingdom,
where all such trials and sufferings are forever excluded.

Thy affectionate friend,

George Crosfield.

From J. W. to Alice Knight.

Hopkinton, 18th of 1st mo., 1843.

Sometimes, my dear sister, in these seasons of deep depression and sore dismay,
1 have been led almost to call in question the ground which, from time to time, had,
as I apprehended, been assigned me; and almost sure I am, that,
had it been made known to me some five years ago, the bonds which awaited such a course,
my confidence would have failed me entirely.
But now, although it seems that the dangers which still await me, the afflictions,
the reproaches, and the buffetings,
are greater than those permitted at the present time to fall upon the
head of a single pilgrim beside whose lot is cast among this people,
the query arises, Shall I go back?
And, although I cannot charge myself with murmuring against the Lord at any time,
yet sometimes I have been chargeable with a lamentation over my own condition,
and have been ready to envy the condition of the meanest creature in this lower world,
if by the exchange I could be liberated from the persecutions of false brethren!

I am not without my fears at times, that ere this campaign shall terminate,
I shall fall a victim by their hands!
Or, like David, in his despondency, when he exclaimed,
"`I shall surely one day fall by the hand of Saul!`"
Or, may not this time to me be comparable to that alluded to by the Saviour:
"`Unless those days be shortened, no flesh should be saved?`"
Well, I see nothing better, after all,
than to yield myself wholly up into the hands and holy keeping of Him,
who hath seen meet to lead me in this thorny and dangerous way,
and to entreat him day and night, for his mercies`' sake, to keep me,
and in his own way and time to deliver me.

And wilt thou not, my precious sister, intercede for an afflicted brother,
and for all the little band of the Lord`'s feeble warriors in New England?
For truly, his people never had greater need of strength and wisdom from above,
than here and at the present time: because the great and the wise, and the rich,
and the learned of this world, both without and within, are combined, heart and hand,
to destroy the best of the Lord`'s testimonies,
and to corrupt his inheritance with the mere work of men`'s hands and vain imaginations.
In the enemy`'s attempts to destroy Quakerism in 1827,
his army was nothing like so strong and formidable as at the present time; for now,
the whole body of professors, save a little remnant of our Society,
are joined in concert against the doctrines of a religion
immediately revealed to the mind and understanding of man.

According to my observation,
by comparing the state of things among professors in my early days,
with that which now exists, it is abundantly evident, notwithstanding the moral reform,
that as it respects true religion, there has been a steady retrograde motion;
a thing which I believe no Society of professing Christians has escaped.
As the life and power have diminished,
the substitute of forms and men`'s inventions has been introduced;
and also a corruption of principles of a fundamental nature has ensued.
And now, to arrest this retrograde motion, increasing, as it appears to do in speed,
is a work of no small importance--is a work which, it looks to me,
no ordinary means will accomplish, even in our own Society;
and if not accomplished in our Society,
the prospect of an improvement in others looks very unpromising.

I have no doubt that the future condition of other religious Societies depends,
in a considerable degree, upon that of our own.
Had not our principles and testimonies been raised up in the world,
as a city set upon a hill, we might well ask,
what would have been the state of professing Christians at this day?
the tendency to turn from the power to the form,
and from the life of Christianity to the mere image of it,
is so great in the human heart!
Hence, seeing so much rests upon us,
(or upon a people raised up to take our place,) how
strong the cause of incitement to faithfulness,
to stem the outgoing tide of infidelity, however arduous the conflict,
and however many the great ships we see, drifting upon it, and borne away with it!

This degenerating spirit had become very popular in England, when I was there,
and has since become greatly increased, and clothed with power;
and great numbers of apparently honest Friends have
since that time fallen down to its image;
and many, if not the most, of those that have not,
are afraid to stand forth and oppose the heresy.
Even some of those who venture to plead for the old ways boldly,
are nevertheless afraid to come out openly against those sentiments which are
most insidiously and rapidly undermining the fundamental principles of Quakerism.
Oh, that they had a George Fox and an Edward Burrough there,
who were not afraid of consequences,
but bore testimony everywhere against all unsound doctrines,
as well as for those which were of the Truth;
nor could the powers of this world deter them from it.
And with what success did they and their friends press forward through all opposition,
because they accounted not their own lives dear in
comparison with the joys set before them,
even the joy of turning men from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.

Now my dear friend, in conclusion I will say, that although I have thus written,
and truly written, in the forepart of this letter, of trying and mournful seasons,
in which my faith has been put to the test, yet,
in justice to the name of everlasting kindness and mercy, I feel bound to acknowledge,
that many seasons of the sweet and precious enjoyment
of heavenly goodness are vouchsafed me,
in which my cup has overflowed with peace and love, and praises have ascended unto Him,
who lives forever and ever; notwithstanding, at other times,
I apprehend that I feel as Jeremiah did, when he wrote his Lamentations.

Dearly Beloved Friend,

I trust I can thus address thee in the fellowship of that gospel
which is the bond of everlasting peace--in that nearness and unity
which I felt with thy spirit when thou came into my room in Philadelphia,
the remembrance of which has often been precious to me, although I was a stranger,
as to the outward, yet not so within.
My mind has often been drawn into near and tender sympathetic feeling with, and for thee,
and under that feeling I am induced to take my pen in hand, though I seldom do so,
to endeavor to encourage and strengthen thee to keep hold of thy shield of faith,
and not cast it away as though it had not been anointed; for it has been anointed,
thou knowest, and has kept thee through many tribulations, both by sea and land,
as well as amongst false brethren, unto this day;
and I pray the Father of all our sure mercies,
that we may be favored to keep it in the patience unto the end.

It is a day of peculiar trial, both of faith and patience, to all the Lord`'s children;
and I feel it very especially so to thee, my dear friend,
and I think I can enter deeply into feeling with thee; for I have been favored to see,
feel and know that foul, dark, deceptive, out-going spirit,
in the time of the spreading of infidelity; and I do now see the very same spirit,
under a different covering; but it is the same out-going deceptive spirit,
which is actuating those who have gone out from the Truth, and they know it not;
and it has happened so to them for want of keeping humble and on the watch;
and these will go on worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived,
until it is openly manifest by what spirit they are actuated, for they are not,
nor will be able to set bounds to themselves,
saying "`Thus far will we go and no farther.`"

Oh, dear friend, it is with me to say to thee, keep in thy habitation,
which is in the munition of rocks, and the storms will not hurt thee,
nor prevent thee from promoting the honor of Him whom thou servest,
or from spreading his cause of truth and righteousness in the earth.
Although the enemy`'s design is to destroy the Lord`'s heritage,
yet the Lord will turn the enemy`'s designs into a blessing to his heritage;
thus he showed me when the enemy seemed so to prevail,
as if he would cut me off from my inheritance amongst the Lord`'s people.
Oh then, very deep was my distress,
but the ways of our Heavenly Father are as a great deep,
for he showed me at that season that he would make
of me an instrument in his own hand and his own way,
to promote his cause, to his own honor, even to the saving of some poor souls.
My heart was then greatly tendered before him, and I said in my heart, "`It is enough.
Let my sufferings be what they may, thy will be done.`"

And now, my dear brother, before I took my pen in hand I thought I felt this testimony,
and I believed it was from the Lord: "`Fear not, my dear servant,
I have permitted this suffering to come upon thee
for my righteous cause and my testimony`'s sake;
I will be with thee, and though thou pass through the waters,
they shall not overflow thee; though thou walk through the fire, it shall not burn thee,
and through the flames, they shall not kindle upon thee,
and I will make of thee yet further an instrument in my hand,
to my honor and to my glory, in a way thou hast not yet seen,
and it shall add to thy rejoicing while yet here, and to thy eternal joy hereafter.`"

I have no doubt there are many amongst you as well as amongst us who would,
if they were to see the language I have used in describing that deceitful spirit,
which is endeavoring to divide us asunder, call it harsh;
but the time has come when it is right for every
one to speak the plain truth to his neighbor,
of what he is favored to see of the workings of this dark, deceptive spirit.
Oh, how I feel for the dear youth, with you and us,
so soon after that awful storm which must have appeared to them
to have rent the very pillars of the Lord`'s house asunder!
And for the few who remain to see another arise so soon after the first is past,
and those who stood as a firm unshaken wall before, now rent asunder--Oh,
I have thought it must be almost enough to cause them to
question there being any true foundation.

I feel willing to show thee a little of the actions of one from your parts,
accounted a gospel minister by some.
I took an opportunity with her, to inquire the cause of their dealing with thee;
she seemed loth to say anything on the subject, but as I earnestly pressed it,
for I did want to know their statement of the case, as she was from the neighborhood,
she finally said thou would not take the advice of thy friends.
I told her it was possible thou wast brought into the situation I once was when I could
not conscientiously take the advice of those that I once believed were my friends;
and if I had been correctly informed, it was the case with thee,
that bearing thy testimony against the unsound views of J. J. Gurney,
was the whole ground of uneasiness; if so,
it was a serious thing for them to try to withhold thee from obeying the Divine command,
of sounding the alarm at the approach of the enemy;
and that I did believe the unsound doctrines published by that man were
as fatal in their consequences as the infidelity published by Elias Hicks,
which had made such a grievous rent in the Society.
She replied that she considered it as bad, or worse.
This gave me an opportunity of opening my views on
the present state of things amongst us,
in the presence of divers young Friends, to some relief of my mind.
I also told them I felt it my religious duty thus to bear a faithful testimony
against these things,--that I had done it when opportunity presented,
and would do it, while I felt as I did, let the consequences, of what men can do,
be what they may.

But oh, my dear friend, what are our feelings,
when we see such who make profession of being ministers,
and travelling for the help of others,
act with so much--I know not what to call it but devilish
deceit--as to make the profession she did to me,
and then to see her own signature to such a document
of charge as that brought against thee!
But such were the inconsistencies of those who went out into infidelity,
and such is and will be the effect of all outgoing spirits; but be of good cheer,
dear friend, thou wilt be comforted when they are tormented.
I would rather be in thy situation and live on bread and water
than to be united with them and possess all they all enjoy,
both within and without, for they will have torment upon torment Oh, wretched state!
Envy is happy only when she herself torments,
but the righteous possess their souls in patience, and rest in the day of trouble,
and in proportion as they are permitted to be afflicted,
will they be favored to joy and rejoice in the God of their salvation;
blessed be his holy name forevermore!

My Dear And Tribulated Friend,

What can I say that will comfort thee,
or that will express the deep sympathy that tenders my spirit towards thee!
But the Lord`'s power is over all!
He has mightily and most mercifully been with thee in all thy afflictions,
sustained and comforted thee with the lifting up of the light of his blessed countenance,
and put a joy and peace into thy heart, with which no stranger can intermeddle.
And so I trust he will still continue to do,
and preserve thee (even to the very end) from being moved
from that steadfastness unto him and humility before him,
which he hath clothed thee with, for the help and example of others,
and for the glory of his own great Name.

In looking at the poor little afflicted remnant, both with you and with us,
how does all that is capable of feeling within me, most earnestly desire (yea,
painfully travail) that we may be preserved, "`in Him that is true,`" and then,
in all our afflictions, he will be afflicted,
and the angel of his presence will be with us, sustain and comfort us,
and in due time save us out of all, bringing us forth as gold seven times tried.
Oh, how great is my fear on my own account,
(and other such weaklings,) lest self should get up, even under these trials,
and work as in a mystery, and so the enemy should get an advantage,
and the spirit become defiled, and the Holy Name be reproached.
Oh, when favored with breathings heavenward, think of us for good,
my dear and valued friend, and crave that we may be kept in self-abasement and holy fear,
whilst enabled, in faith, faithfulness, and patience,
to stand firm for the pure testimony of Truth,
and to be afflicted and mourn for the defection therefrom.

Thy account, in thy last kind letter of 27th 12 mo.,
of the transactions of that overbearing committee of your Yearly Meeting,
and of your appeal against the hasty judgment of the Quarterly Meeting,
was truly satisfactory, and it was a comfort to hear how you had been supported,
and enabled to conduct in wisdom, and meekness, and firmness;
and so was the account mentioned in thy letter to G. and M. Crosfield,
of which I saw a copy from dear Ann Jones,
inasmuch as it bore testimony to the Divine goodness and
power which had so marvellously helped and preserved thee,
my dearly beloved ancient brother, in such a season of extremity.

And truly, I may say,
the hearts of some (to whom I have communicated what I could of these things,
in the confidence of near unity) have, with mine,
overflowed with gratitude and humble praise to Him, the mighty strengthener,
the blessed comforter of his tribulated people,
and our faith and hope in him has hereby been afresh strengthened and confirmed,
and our breathings have been for thy help and preservation still,
even as the prayers for Peter formerly, in prison.
Ah!
I do trust the root and bottom of all things will in due time be manifested,
and the Truth arise, even over all!
And what though we be reduced to a "`very small remnant,`"
yet if thoroughly purged and entirely knit together in Him,
the Life, we may yet be strong as an army with the banners of Truth!

Stockport, 1st of 4th month, 1843.

My Dear Friend and Brother in the Bonds and Tribulations
of The Gospel of Jesus Christ our Lord--

Although men may separate thee from their company,
may reject and deny thee the privileges of a minister
and member in our once highly favored Society,
yet they can no more separate thee from the living body,
whereof Jesus Christ is the true and holy head,
than the persecutors of our dear faithful Friends
in the beginning could separate them from Him,
the true and living Vine, whence they derived their sap and nourishment,
their unity and strength, to stand against all the wiles and stratagems, and cunning,
subtle snares of Satan and his agents.
Then be not fainthearted, neither fear, but lift up thy head in hope;
believing that thy deliverance from all the power of the enemy draweth near,
whether thy natural eyes may see Jacob and Israel rejoice and be glad
because that the Lord most high hath redeemed and delivered them,
yea or nay.

Thy truly acceptable letter, dated 20th of 12th mo., was mine on the 16th of 1st,
plaintive and true, as the lamentation over Israel is;
yet I could but rejoice and give thanks in finding how sweetly thy mind has been sustained,
by an invisible hand, through much crimination and oppression.
Well, the power of thy accusers and oppressors is limited;
and whilst I doubt not thou hast many times had cause to be and hast been comforted
in considering Him who endured the contradiction of sinners against himself,
and hast thereby been kept from growing weary of suffering or fainting in thy mind;
I can and do earnestly desire for thee that thy faith
may be renewed and strengthened from time to time,
not only to commit thy cause unto him, and to trust in his holy name,
but also to remember that the cause is His with whom is the power
to bring good out of that which seemeth at the time,
to finite, short-sighted mortals, to be what may be termed evil,
as "`the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church,`"
and the shedding of the precious blood of Christ,
as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot, was the purchase of our redemption.
When the poor disciples were dismayed at what had happened, and said, even to himself,
"`we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel,`" ah,
then how little did they think that they were speaking to their crucified and risen Lord!
And thus it is in our day; we know but in part, we see but as it were through a glass,
darkly or dimly; but then, says the apostle, "`shall I know even as also I am known.`"

After I received thine, I heard nothing from America for a considerable time,
and was ready to conclude that the committees had thought better of it,
and in consequence of the proposed appeals had dropped the matter of disownment,
at least for a time; but on the 15th ult.
I received a truly acceptable and sympathizing letter from dear Thomas Evans,
informing that thou art actually disowned.
T+++.+++ E. writes very feelingly and sorrowfully respecting this procedure, and says:
"`It is deeply to be lamented that matters have been pushed so far,
and such a determination evinced to carry points,
and to infringe on the constitutional rights of members.
What it will all end in, is hard to say;
on every hand the clouds thicken and a deep gloom seems to be spreading over our Society.`"
My mind is much with thee and thy dear family,
and the faithful Friends of South Kingston Monthly Meeting,
believing you will be supported and carried safely through all to the praise of His name,
the glory of his power,
who has called and strengthened you to stand and to suffer
for his name and Truth and testimony`'s sake.

In much love and tender sympathy for thee and thy wife and children,
I am thy friend in the bonds of the gospel,

My Very Dear Friend,

Alexander Parker, an ancient worthy, in writing to Margaret Fell, thus addresses her:
"`Though for some time I have been silent in this manner of speaking to thee,
yet is not my love in any measure diminished, but rather augmented;
and I often remember thee in thy sufferings,
and thou (with all the faithful in Christ) art dear and near unto me;`"--which,
as it seemed to convey what I wished to say to thee,
in better language than I can usually command, I thought fit to copy.
He adds: "`I hope thou art, as formerly,
sensible of the integrity and innocent true simplicity of my heart,
both towards God and all his people, for Truth is my delight,
and in the work and service of God I labor;
it is my meat and drink to do the will of God,
and therein I am fully resolved to continue even to the end.`"

Now although I do not by any means feel qualified to adopt language
as strong as he used in the latter part of this sentence,
yet I can respond both to the hope and the resolution which he expresses;
inasmuch as that which in my very young and tender years was revealed as the Truth,
continues to be my delight; whenever I can see it in any measure prosper,
therein I can rejoice, and on the contrary,
(which is by far the most common in this our day,
as thou very well knowest,) I often sensibly feel that it is still,
through unmerited mercy, my privilege to suffer with it and, as I trust, for it,
in some small degree--of which, however small, I often feel myself unworthy.

It seemed truly remarkable, that she +++[+++Catharine Sheppard]
should have been led to think and speak of thee at such a time.
I have thought of it with interest in connection with poor dear P. P`'s dying benediction.
Surely there must be consolation ministered, by these things, to thy oft-times, no doubt,
almost desponding mind.
Are not these "`morsels`" better and more to be desired,
coming as they do from the Lord`'s people, than all the favors of his enemies?
Yet I can but lament the great weakness, among many of those who, I doubt not,
are very sincere in their love to him and regard for thee,
which induces them to "`break their bread in secret.`"
Although Solomon, I believe, did say such bread was pleasant,
yet it would be more agreeable, I think, to the word of Truth,
the substance of faith and the nature and character of our holy profession,
if there was less of secrecy "`for fear of the Jews.`"
I am thinking more particularly of some of our Philadelphia Friends--of
whom in this respect I think we have considerable to bear;
and they that are strong, I suppose, can bear it; but for others,
I fear lest their faith, patience and constancy should fail.

And although it may be best for us generally to pay
due attention to their advice from Philadelphia,
yet I have little expectation that it will make much more difference, in the end,
than this, namely, putting it out of their power to say we rejected it.
As for our being officially acknowledged by that Yearly Meeting in its present state,
except in connection with the Gurneyites here,
or in the event of their being "`put down,`" as they say,
I have no expectation of it at present.
There is too much of the same spirit which rules here, at work among them,
either secretly or openly, to admit of it;
and I fear some of the best among them hear and take counsel for us,
of that spirit working in the great ones, and the high ones, and the experienced ones,
in a mystery, being themselves quite ignorant of it.
Oh! for more inwardness and retiredness of spirit to the "`Wonderful
Counsellor,`" that we might be truly guided in judgment;
and then, although Abraham might be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not,
yet we could say, "`Doubtless thou, O God! art our Father,`" etc.

I must conclude, with dear love to thy wife,
for whom I very often feel more sympathy than I can express in words,
of which I believe she has been at times in some measure sensible;
and to whom I am under very many and great obligations, which I cannot forget.
Farewell.

My Dear Thomas,

Thine of the 16th was received on the 19th,
and none the less welcome on account of the company it kept, to wit,
with one of a similar cast from dear Ann Jones;
and although they had not travelled long together,
they seemed to be of one heart and one mind; and I was made glad,
amid the gloom of persecution,
in recognizing the sweet salutations which are breathed forth in them.
And for thy information I will say,
that the volume containing those excellent letters from which thou extracted those instructive
lines from one to another of our faithful predecessors in the blessed Truth,
was sent to me many months ago by my endeared friend Lydia A. Barclay.
Oh! how animating, to read those living salutations, and how they tend to awaken,
and to quicken,
and make alive renewedly the immortal birth in whomsoever it has been begotten,
and cause it to leap for joy, and to strengthen,
and produce an increase and enlargement in the inward life and power,
when read at those seasons wherein the more immediate
beam of the Sun of Righteousness is revealed in us,
tending to glory, honor, immortality and eternal life!

Letters have been recently received from England,
from +++_______+++, +++_______+++, +++_______+++, etc.,
but none so truly apostolic and full of life,
as Ann Jones`'s but one from dear Ezra Comfort, some little time ago,
is truly of the first cast, in which, like that of A. J.,
there is no compromise with evil, nor shadow of turning.
Oh! for such fearless warriors as these,
who will not turn their backs in the day of battle, nor give any ground to the enemy,
because they know that their Leader is invincible, and goeth before them,
and covereth their heads; and because they know too, in some degree,
the worth of God`'s testimonies to his people, and the sacrilege of abandoning them.
Thy notices of the unity and fellowship of several dear friends,
are comfortable and encouraging, as well as those above named; but,
Oh! my dear Thomas and Martha,
if it were not for the inward sustaining and approval of a blessed Redeemer,
at times and seasons vouchsafed,
all that even you or any other dear fellow travellers could offer,
would be of little avail, in allaying the troubled waters, which seem ready, sometimes,
to overwhelm my tribulated spirit.

Be assured that I remain thy truly sympathizing friend in all the trials which
await the exercise of the Lord`'s gift among a stiff-necked and rebellious people.
Farewell.

Dear Friend,

My mind is much with thee and thy dear suffering friends in New England,
greatly desiring your steadfast abiding in the ever-blessed Truth,
let others do as they may.
There is a place of rest, even in the day of trouble,
a refuge from the heat and the storm.
Jerusalem remains to be a quiet habitation,
a tabernacle that shall not be taken down--not one
of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed,
nor one of the cords thereof broken,
for there the glorious Lord remains to us a place of broad rivers and streams--yea,
those streams which make glad the whole city and heritage of God.
Thou knowest, dear friend,
that no gallant ships float there,--no galley with oars
passeth thereby,--no none of the cunning artifice,
or merchandise of men is found there.

But oh, I have seen, in that light that doth not deceive,
that there are many amongst you, in your land, who are making a high profession,
even to be of the very city of God, and boast much of the streams thereof,
who are trafficking in almost all kinds of merchandise of men, yea,
even with the very souls of men, and are floating on the muddy waters of Babylon,
and drinking of its streams, and are in sore captivity,
and I am afraid some of them know it not.
Oh, the mystery of iniquity--in the transforming of the serpent even into an angel of light,
in order, if possible, to deceive the very elect!

May we, dear friend and Friends everywhere,
for whose welfare in this day of proving my soul travails day and night,
be kept continually on our watch, in the light of the Lord,
that we may be preserved on that sure foundation,
against which the gates of hell never have, and never will be able to prevail.
It is cause of deep thankfulness that we are favored to see the snares of the enemy,
and be preserved.
Oh, it is a great favor that we are permitted to suffer with the suffering seed.
Dear friend, and friends, who feel and act with thee,
think not the time of your sufferings long!
The Lord hath a purpose in permitting it to be, that it shall redound to his own glory,
and to your everlasting peace; and,
dear John 1 believe there are children yet unborn who will call thee blessed,
because of thy faithfulness in earnestly contending
for the faith once delivered to the saints.

I have often thought of Francis Howgill`'s travail of soul, since being with you,
and I believe his testimony that he delivered in the name of the Lord,
will be fulfilled concerning you,--"`The sun shall lose its shining brightness,
and cease to give light to the world;
the moon shall be altogether darkness and give no light unto the night;
the stars shall cease to know their office; my covenant with day and night,
times and seasons, shall sooner come to an end,
than the covenant I have made with this people, into which they have entered with me,
shall end or be broken.
Yea, though the powers of darkness and hell combine against them,
and the jaws of death open for them, yet I will deliver them, and lead them through all.
I will confound their enemies as I did in Jacob, and scatter them as I did in Israel,
in the days of old.
I will take their enemies; I will hurl them hither and thither,
as stones are hurled in a sling; and the memorial of this nation, which is holy unto me,
shall never be rooted out, but shall live through ages,
as a cloud of witnesses in generations to come.
I have brought them to the birth, yea, I have brought them forth; I have swaddled them,
and they are mine.
I will nourish them and carry them as on eagles`' wings;
and though clouds gather against them, I will make a way through them;
though darkness gather together as an heap, and tempests gender,
I will scatter them as with an east wind; and nations shall know they are my inheritance,
and they shall know that I am the living God,
who will plead their cause with all that rise up in opposition against them.`"

This servant of the Lord, who was then in prison,
testified that his heart was filled with joy, although a prisoner until death,
even as when the ark of God was brought from the house of Obed-Edom,
when David danced before it, and Israel shouted for joy.
May this be thy, and your blessed experience!
I have often thought of latter time,
of the testimony of these worthy sons of the morning,
that of all the grievous sufferings they met with,
the greatest were occasioned by false brethren;
but I think there is no cause for discouragement.
We see, and it will be made more and more manifest,
that those who are now lording it over God`'s heritage, are unsound,
and have departed from the faith and principles of the Society;
and are not transacting the affairs thereof agreeably
to the order established by the Head of the church,
for which purpose, our different meetings were especially instituted.

Friends were all to wait upon the Lord,
in order to receive a renewed divine qualification to transact its business,
for it is the Lord`'s work, and cannot be performed aright without such qualification,
any more than a minister can preach the gospel without it.
But it is now done out of meeting,
and all the concerns that ought to come before these bodies,
are now arranged by committees appointed for the purpose,
who deliberate in private councils, and there contrive, plan and do the business,
in the strength and wisdom of the creature,
thereby depriving the rest of the members of their right
to participate in the concerns that deeply interest them;
and they also undertake to judge all such of their brethren,
and condemn them as not being fit to meddle with the affairs of the church,
who in any way dissent from what they do in these private councils.

They also disregard the discipline, established by divine Wisdom;
thus they are separating themselves from other bodies
of Friends who are favored to dwell together in unity,
and who are laboring harmoniously together for Truth`'s honor.
May you, dear friends, keep in your habitations, standing steadfast in your allotments.
I believe, in time +++[+++your oppressors]
will be so controlled by divine Providence as to open a way themselves for your release.
And dear John, don`'t be discouraged from prosecuting thy appeal; however trying it may be.
Thou may, in this way,
be instrumental in opening the eyes of some innocent Friends who are in
danger of being ensnared by that deceptive spirit and led astray.
I feel deeply for these.

Tell my and thy dear friends as far as thou mayest have opportunity,
that my love remains toward them and thyself in that fellowship that changeth not;
and tell our dear young Friends I was comforted when with you,
in believing that they will be prepared, through suffering,
and favored yet to bring the ark of the Lord`'s testimony on their shoulders rejoicing,
to its place in Jerusalem.
It is now on a cart, and the oxen are shaking it, and the Uzzahs are laying hold of it,
in an unsanctified manner,
but the Lord will make a breach amongst them in his own time,--they never will
be permitted to bring the ark to its place which God has appointed for it,
by the course they are pursuing.

Farewell, my dear friend in the Lord.
I remain thine.

My Dear Friend,

Thy truly welcome letter of 11th mo., 29th, came to hand soon after date.
I had been thinking much about my afflicted friends in New England
and my spirit had been closely dwelling with thee in tribulation;
it was not unexpected to me to hear that thy appeal is resting as it is,
and although it may sometimes be a trial of faith and patience,
and desires may arise to know the event,
yet the language does continue sealed on my mind, "`The Lord will work,
and who shall let.`"
And, let this matter be decided as it may,
my faith is that a benefit will arise to our poor
Society from thy honest integrity in the way of Truth,
not flinching from thy post to gain favor from man,
even though the cruel enemy has greatly sought thy downfall in this way.

And if thou shouldst never see the day when thy rights
in religious society shall be restored to thee,
thy patient endurance in suffering will not be lost;
but children shall rise up and call thee blessed, saying "`he hath done what he could.`"
According to my observation,
a mark of distinction is becoming more and more set upon those
that are endeavoring to gain proselytes in the wisdom of man,
and it is becoming more and more manifest who are
serving the Lord and who serveth him not;
but there is a struggle between Christ and antichrist, for the church`'s sake,
and the Lord most high who maketh war in righteousness,
will surely continue to gather to himself a people that can sing his praise.
I feel the present to be a day of close trial and
deep proving to the living children everywhere;
and I believe our poor Society will have much to suffer yet, before the dross,
and the tin, and the reprobate silver is consumed by the fire of God`'s word.

Things in Baltimore look very discouraging.
It seemed to me, if there was a shred there of the spirit of true discernment,
that was able to try words fitly spoken, as the mouth trieth meat,
it was amongst some of the little, humble, silent ones,
that would tremble at hearing their own voices;
and oh! that there were more of this number, for I fear it is very small.
The Yearly Meeting was the greatest time of outpouring of words that I ever witnessed,
I think, and the people seemed to feed upon it, but when anything was said,
striking at the root of their false rest, and sounding the word of alarm,
they were ready to judge it down,
and out of meeting made great effort to make it appear
that their state was a very good one.

So thou mayest judge a little of the trial we underwent;
yet I believe it was all in the ordering of best wisdom,
and if our lot was cast there for little more than a ballast,
I believe the end was answered; for we felt that we were a thorn in their sides.
Our dear friend David Cope did not, I believe, open his mouth in meeting,
except once to discipline, but with ourselves,
could say he felt the reward of peace for having
been made willing to suffer for the name of Jesus.
Thy countryman, L. M. Hoag was, a lodger in the house with us, and was very much caressed.
A woman who was not a member, but an attender of Friends`' meeting at Germantown,
told one of the elders directly after meeting,
she supposed Friends did not know what kind of a preacher
he was when they appointed him the meeting.

As far as I know,
Friends generally speak well of our "`Ancient Testimony`"--some
I fear are endeavoring to cloak themselves with it.
But I believe the day is coming when the unrighteous
work of man`'s invention will be tried,
and the day will declare it of what sort it is;
and sometimes when the enemy is suffered to come in like
a flood and my spirit is almost overwhelmed in suffering,
I am cheered in the remembrance that there is laid in Zion a chief Corner-Stone,
a sure foundation, and help is laid upon One that is mighty to save, and able to deliver,
even to the uttermost, all those that trust in him.
And do we not my dear friend, sometimes realize that "`He will keep him in perfect peace,
whose mind is stayed on him, because he trusteth in him?`"
In conclusion, although I feel myself but a child, I can greet thee and thy dear wife,
in the language of encouragement,
to stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made you free.

I conclude, thy near sympathizer and, I trust, fellow-sufferer in tribulation,
for the body`'s sake, which is the church,

My Beloved Friend,

Although I have not felt ability hitherto, nor at this time,
to clothe my feelings in words, and so to salute thee in that love which springs from,
centres in, and returns to that pure spring from whence all good proceeds,
yet thou wast brought to my remembrance so sweetly yesterday morning,
whilst sitting with my friends assembled in meeting, and a language, applicable,
as I then believed, to thee, in thy present suffering and deeply proving state,
was presented so livingly that I feel I cannot do otherwise
than just revive the words in thy tribulated mind,
even should they be offered for thy acceptance without note
or comment:--"`Blessed are ye when men shall revile you,
and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you, falsely, for my sake.
Rejoice, and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven;
for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.`"

I remembered that at (I think) the last Yearly Meeting of London,
at which dear S. Grubb was present, I was sitting with her in her own lodging,
and she was, in much freedom,
opening to me some of her sore conflicts which befell her in that great city,
(to which I was then looking to remove as my habitation,) acquainting me with
the opposition she encountered in the discharge of her duty to her Master,
and of the manner in which she was spoken of; we sat awhile in silence, when the words,
"`If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub,
how much more will they call them of his household,`" came so to me,
that I ventured to express them, on which the dear,
faithful woman looked up at me with a brightened countenance, and in much simplicity,
said, "`I never thought of that!`"

Thus, dear friend, I have thought that,
as a child is sometimes employed to hand a cup of cold water to a father or a mother,
for their refreshment, and be comforted in finding that it has proved so,
I might hand this to thee, whom I may truly say,
did seem as a father in the church of Christ, when thou wast sent amongst us;
more especially as thy parting words to me were like
the meat which sustained one formerly for many days.
And now, my endeared friend, farewell!
May the Lord`'s Truth ever be thy shield and buckler,
is the prayer of one who remains thy affectionate friend, in every trial.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

Thy letter, although it has thus long remained unanswered,
was truly grateful and strengthening;
the fellow-feeling and near sympathy of absent brethren,
communicated in times of trouble and great depression, is indeed as a healing balm,
and tends to console the drooping mind, and to sweeten, for a season, the bitter cup;
and especially when coming from one who has drunk deeply of the same cup of sore affliction,
and has witnessed those indescribable sensations
inflicted by the cruel hands of false brethren;
a true sense whereof I am persuaded that neither pen nor tongue can convey
to those who have not themselves drunk of the gall and the wormwood;
of which even the Saviour of the world himself received at the hand of man.

No; but thou, my dear friend, knowest, by painful experience,
the bitterness and the reproaches which have always been heaped
upon the faithful testimony-bearers in the days of persecution.
And I had never been so well prepared until later time,
to sympathize and partake with our early suffering brethren,
in their sore persecutions and deep sufferings for the Lord`'s testimonies.
How truly instructive the counsel and exhortations of those whose
experience was perfected by the things which they had suffered;
and perhaps there is rarely anything to be found more so,
than the encouragement contained in the extracts which thou kindly sent.

If confirmation of the rectitude of our cause here in New England were in any wise wanting,
the conduct, duplicity,
and treachery of our persecutors supply abundant
evidence that they are in the very same spirit,
which has persecuted the faithful followers of the
Lamb in almost every age of the Christian church.
In recently looking over the history of the church,
from the apostles`' times nearly down to the present,
I find many transactions recorded of those who professed
to be acting for Christ and for his holy church,
whose actions nevertheless were strongly impressed with
the mark of the beast and the number of his name,
and strikingly answering as face unto face in a glass,
unto many professions and proceedings in this our day;
clearly showing the enmity and malice of the same old enemy of God`'s heritage,
and his practice of all manner of deceit and falsehood,
for the ensnaring and destruction of the Lord`'s people and their testimonies,
and aiming his deadly arrows at those little humble ones who dare not
forego the covenant which Israel`'s Shepherd made with their forefathers,
and has often renewed with them.

And these,
oh! how continually are they crying and lifting up their
hearts and hands unto their only Helper and Preserver,
that he would in mercy turn aside the arrows of the destroyer,
so that their lives might be spared, and his name not dishonored; for,
next to that of their own lives being given to them as a prey,
is their prayer and their concern for the lives of his whole flock,
and for those dignified doctrines and testimonies,
which are the stakes and landmarks of his enclosure, and the armory of defence,
whereby his sheepfold is protected from the ravages of the beast of prey.

I trust and hope, my dear friend and brother,
that both thyself and all the living witnesses of our sufferings,
will not fail at times to put up petitions for us,
and for the sustaining of the Lord`'s good cause in this land;
that through his own power and good pleasure,
a remnant at least may be spared to give glory to his great and excellent name,
and to stand as witnesses to that Truth into which he led and established our forefathers.
My opponents are quite ready at finding excuses for protracting the trial of my appeal,
and it now stands referred to the last second day in the first month, at Providence,
where I suppose they were resolved to have the case tried.
But I am full in the faith that He, whose power is over all,
can turn all into good to those who love him and serve him; and in the same faith,
I trust that whatsoever is permitted to befall me,
will in the end tend to my good and to God`'s glory,
if indeed I am favored to endure all with patience,
and to trust in him entirely for strength and wisdom.

In much love to thyself and family, and dear Alice Knight,
in which my wife and family unite,
I conclude in that which I hope will abide with us forever, and am thine,

My Dear Aged and Afflicted Friend,

This is the appellation and address which lives in my mind towards thee from day to day,
and which I have desired for many weeks past an opportunity
to greet thee with--but many engagements,
many hindrances, and not a few discouragements have prevented the accomplishment of it.
However it be, whether I write or am silent,
the precious bond of gospel fellowship is not lessened or interrupted;
and whether thou art a sensible partaker of the joys and consolations of the gospel,
or the fountain of living waters is for a time like a spring shut up, a fountain sealed,
and the Lord may, in inscrutable wisdom,
be known to thee by the name of the Lord that hideth his face from the house of Jacob,
still I believe thy soul is and will be kept alive even in famine;
and at times the experience will be thine, that in proportion as thy tribulations abound,
so also thy consolations will abound in and through Christ Jesus,
the everliving and holy head and high priest of his church,
which he hath purchased with his own most precious blood.
Ah! fear not, neither be dismayed; he knows who they are that suffer,
and what this living number suffer, for his name and truth and testimony`'s sake.

27th. Thy deeply interesting and truly affecting letter of the 1st of 7th mo.
was mine on the 28th. I have let several Friends see it,
who are interested in the maintenance of the principles and testimonies of Truth, viz:
L+++.+++ A. Barclay, G. Crosfield, Croudson Tunstall, etc., all of these named have, I believe,
written to thee since; I hope thou hast received their letters,
and that they have had an encouraging and strengthening
effect on thy depressed and drooping mind.
May the Lord Jehovah be thy stay and thy exceeding great reward.
However the enemies of Truth may triumph for a time,
and vaunt as lords over the heritage,
I cannot doubt but their spirit and unrighteous proceedings,
will be made manifest in the Lord`'s time,
though to our finite reason and short sight it may be deferred till some of the well-minded,
though inexperienced ones are beguiled and led astray.

Alas! there is a great want of a single eye to the glory of God, and a firm, steady,
upright walk before him, neither warped by favor, affection,
or fear of man--but righteously determining, "`Let others do as they may, as for me,
I will serve the Lord.`"
But as a people we are too much in affinity with the world,
loving and courting its favor and friendship, unwilling to be baptized into death,
that so we may be raised from spiritual death by the power
of Him who is the Resurrection and the Life,
having the spiritual senses and faculties exercised by reason of use,
to discern both good and evil.
Thus many who from their stations and standing in society ought to be way-marks to others,
are themselves partially blind, unwilling to see,
and afraid to risk their reputation among men;
so they "`err in vision and stumble in judgment.`"
But blessed be the name of Israel`'s Rock,
we have still some clear-sighted ones remaining or raised up,
to stand for the Truth in innocent boldness.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

Perhaps there is not another within the circle of my acquaintance so well qualified
through living experience to sympathize with me under the continued portion,
and accumulated weight of suffering,
which has fallen to my lot in this sad day of treading
down and shaking among the professors under our name,
if not amongst many others.
And I trust that thou art more understandingly prepared to say than I am,
"`One woe is past, and behold,
another woe cometh,`" and to see that the fulfillment of the prediction is true,
and the interpretation thereof sure;
and art more fully aware of the indispensable necessity
of abiding steadfast and immovable on the sure Foundation,
during this great storm and mighty shaking, as it were, both of the earth and heavens.

For it is not enough now that the minds of Quakers
be shaken from their grasp of earthly treasures,
and the friendship of the world,
but that they should be shaken from their own--from
the delusive contrivances and inventions of men,
seeking to find an easy way to heaven,
aside from the painful process of piercing asunder between soul and spirit,
joints and marrow, whereby the thoughts and intents of the heart are revealed, through,
and only through, a drinking with the Lord Jesus, in a measure,
of the cup of his sufferings.
He who flatters himself with the hope of a heavenly mansion,
without a humbling submission to this sword of the Spirit,
which separates the precious from the vile,
will meet with the most sore and forlorn disappointment.
Oh! how sad that it is so, that,
through the love of ease and an unwillingness to endure the sanctifying
power of the cross of Christ through the depths of his purgations,
such a spirit should have found an entrance into
the minds of so many who once knew better days!

On again reading over thy letter of 7th mo., 23rd, my dear friend,
which was received in due time, my heart has been made to leap for joy again,
in beholding the excellency--the inexpressible favor of the Lord`'s mercies,
in keeping his suffering children from falling and from despair; and whilst I write,
I feel bowed under a sense of my own utter insufficiency;
and that it is of the Lord`'s power only that I have not fallen
into the hands of those who have been striving for my downfall;
it is marvellous in mine eyes,
that I have been mercifully so far preserved in holding
fast to the law and to the testimony.

Oh! let the praise be ascribed only to his great and blessed name; for surely,
without his unmerited and gracious interposition, I must, long before this,
have been numbered among the dead, to the dishonor of the good cause.
Well, my dear brother, I am not alone,
but as one among a few solitary sufferers here in New England, whose eyes are lifted up,
and whose hearts are poured out before our blessed Shepherd,
in deep suffering under the unrelenting hand of the oppressor,
with prayers night and day for patience and wisdom, to endure,
and to honor the cause which we are called to support,
whilst the enemy is making stronger and stronger
his armory for an exterminating warfare against us.
Their plan is now nearly consummated,
of excluding all in this Quarterly Meeting from service,
except those who have been trained in the new school.

More disownments will likely soon follow.
Thomas B. Gould is now under their oppressive hands, in the character of overseers,
and all others who seem qualified and are undaunted in support of the good cause,
now stand as marks for the archers; but it was believed that,
notwithstanding the success of the Gurneyites in
carrying their measures in our late Quarterly Meeting,
the cause of Truth gained, rather than lost,
by the coming out of some of our younger men,
and opening things pretty plainly before the meeting;
opportunities not likely to be allowed them much longer.

Thus, my dear brother, in a few words,
I have opened to thee the present state of things among us,
by which thou wilt see the increasing necessity of an understanding better than our own,
to guide us along in safety through this cruel warfare, that is waged against us,
for the alone reason that we feel bound by the sacred
obligations of loyalty to the best of causes,
and to His requirings whose that cause is.
And I am satisfied that next to the immediate guidance
and upholding of the divine Hand and Power,
have been the sympathy, the advices,
and the prayers of dear Friends and brethren in other parts of this land,
as well as in Europe;
by whose availing intercessions our hands have been sustained and strengthened.
These, or similar troubles are likely, as far as I can now see,
to pass through the whole camp,
in such manner as that the cause is one with the faithful everywhere,
tending mutually to bind them together, and to induce them to help one another,
by adding strength to strength, in coming up to the help of the Lord against the mighty.

My salutation, my beloved friend, in the love of the gospel, and in great tenderness,
is to thee, and to all that are faithful in Christ Jesus,
counting not their own lives dear in comparison with the
love of God and the testimony of his life and power;
and so I remain thy friend and brother,

My Dear Friend,

Although much engaged,
I cannot persuade myself to suffer tomorrow morning`'s
mail to pass by without a few lines to thee and Martha,
and all the rest of you, who are resolved to ride out the storm through all;
if indeed the very best management on their own part,
and full trust and confidence in Him whose way is in the deep,
and who has for his chariot the wings of the wind,
will bring their little bark in good time to some quiet and peaceful haven,
where the enemies of the testimonies of the Lord`'s heritage cannot come--no,
neither here nor hereafter!
And I am noways destitute, my dear fellow-sufferers,
of an assurance of the aboundings of God`'s love and tender mercies,
over all and through all, to those his living children,
who are now in the midst of great tribulations;
out of which he will assuredly bring them,
as they patiently endure the buffetings of the mighty foe, through his ministers,
for a little season.

And however grievous and painful to be borne,
let us even rejoice and be glad for His great name`'s sake,
for which we are permitted to suffer, and remember the promise,
that "`the rod of the wicked shall not always rest
upon the lot of the righteous;`" for he will,
for the elect`'s sake, shorten those days,
and for the sake of those who are given up to love and serve him, he will arise speedily,
and deliver them from the hand of their enemies.
He will compassionate his own people, as well as regard his own testimonies.
His own people, however few in number,
by the hand of his Providence shall escape the deluge,
for the upholding of his name in the earth;
for behold he is despised and blasphemed at the head of every street,
and the wicked triumph over the flock of his pasture.

How plain it is that Quaker preachers, who have but ordinary natural talent,
and no school learning,
when they turn aside from the source from which they
had usually drawn afresh their supplies,
and enlist under the banners of men, make miserable work of it.
Tools are not so much to blame, as those who use them.
And all such works as these will certainly turn to
the furtherance and accomplishment of God`'s purposes,
in the separation of that which serveth him, from that which serveth him not.
My dear Thomas, let none of these things move thee.
Remember, persecution by the world and by false brethren,
has been the lot of the righteous in all ages.
Despair not, but cherish the gift; and it will take root downward with the greater force,
the more it is trodden under the feet of ungodly men:
and then the storehouse will be full, and enlarged,
against the day of Israel`'s deliverance from his bondage.

Frankford 6th mo., 10th, 1844.

Notwithstanding I have written the last letter to my dear friend John Wilbur,
I feel a strong inclination to avail myself of this medium of converse with thee,
as the only one that seems to be granted me at the time,
according to the good order of church discipline.
Thou hast no doubt heard ere this, that thy poor,
feeble and unworthy correspondent has done what she could
in resigning herself to be a sharer with you in suffering,
at your Yearly Meeting, for the testimonies of Truth,
in support of the doctrines of the gospel of our dear Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
which he continues to keep very dear and precious in the hearts
of some of you (and I hope not a few) in your part of his heritage,
yes, worth suffering deeply for, which does even now redound to his glory and honour,
and, if steadfastness is abode in to the end,
will even more and more show forth his praise.

Oh, the desire that I sometimes feel for all his suffering children everywhere,
that may at seasons be made to feel that the muddy
waters compass them about even to the soul,
that they are enclosed in its depths, and the weeds are wrapt about their heads;
that they may continue to feel that their only helper is the Lord of Hosts;
for he will surely keep these in his house of prayer and when they may
be suffered to feel that their poor souls are ready to faint within them,
he, the Lord, will strengthen them from his holy temple.

We have recently heard the Gurneyites have taken up the cases of
+++_______+++ +++_______+++ and +++_______+++ +++_______+++. I was surprised to hear it,
supposing ere this, they must see their works are dark;
but alas! how often do we see the sorrowful effects produced,
to the blinding of the eyes;
yea of those who once give themselves up to listen to the deceiver of mankind.
And are not these things permitted,
and they suffered to continue in their unrighteous works,
in order to open the eyes of some who have not yet
been able to see into the mystery of iniquity,
and in order to hasten the day of separation from these people?

I greatly desire the encouragement of all these under
treatment as well as other rightly exercised Friends,
to faithfulness in contending for the Truth, without fearing consequences.
But why need I write thus to a father,
who has taken many more deep lessons in the school of Christ than I have done?
And I greatly feel that I have need of the prayers of the
faithful for my safe abiding on the sure Foundation,
patient under every suffering dispensation,--for I feel it to be a day of deep trial,
wherein it is all important to remember the watchword
given by our blessed Saviour to his disciples formerly,
"`Watch and pray,`" and I believe there are seasons when we may feel that we cannot pray,
yet we can watch.
And I believe my dear friend will understand me,
and that this is a little effusion of the exercises I daily feel,
in looking towards your approaching annual assembly,
and the very important decisions that may be come to there,
for I think I may say I feel bound with my dear, suffering friends,
in bonds for the sake of the gospel.

I believe sometimes when we are not called upon openly
to speak against such as we cannot fully unite with,
we are nevertheless bound to bear testimony in silence.
In this we may be accounted as fools and even hated by the worldly wise;
and sometimes such things feel hard to bear;
yet there are seasons when we are made to rejoice
in him through whom the victory was obtained.
I believe thou wilt understand me in this,
and I think thou canst unite with me in the sentiment,
that there are some Friends we meet with, to whom we can get very near, though strangers;
whom we feel as bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh--kindred spirits met;
to whom we can impart our religious views without any reserve.
There are others that generally speak the same language, and seem very friendly,
to whom we may even desire to impart our feelings and views,
yet there is something that is as a barrier between us.

I want sound Friends to stand firm and faithful, for now is the time;
but if no way should clearly open when the time comes,
I am far from desiring any step taken without a sensible
feeling of the sanction of Truth in your movements.
For I continue firm in the belief that the Lord will work for you and with you,
for deliverance, in his own time and way.
May all the rightly exercised be encouraged to put on the whole armor of faith!

A letter from thee is always gladly received by thy unworthy correspondent,

My Dear And Honored Friend,

My mind seemed so much with thee the last week that I think I must (though in a poor,
low spot myself) take pen and tell thee so,
assuring thee that thou art very near and dear to me and
I trust a number more in this land who remember thy faithful
spirit and labor of love amongst us in days that are past,
wherein thou wast (made of God!) a great comfort to an afflicted remnant amongst us,
who have felt melted into tender sympathy with thee
in the hearing of thy sore trials of latter years;
the worst sort of all, namely, from false brethren!

And we rejoice that thou art preserved in a noble yet humble spirit,
willing to suffer for the pure testimony of the everlasting Truth,
and hast been (as indeed we doubted not) so marvellously
sustained and supported under such deep afflictions,
yea, wonderfully comforted with a peace which the afflicters can never give,
neither can they take away when it flows in the soul like the streams of a refreshing
river! blessed be the Father of mercies and God of all sure consolation who gives it!
And my dear friend, I hope and trust thou art thus supported and comforted at this time,
which I have been remembering is the time of your Yearly Meeting,
and when I suppose thy private appeal will come forward,
but it is not likely with any better success than the other last year,
seeing there are such unjust and unconstitutional measures resorted to;
yet we do know there is a Power who can in a moment withdraw man from his purpose,
and overturn all the devices of the wisdom of man!

Then it is unto Him alone that we must commit thee,
our dearly beloved friend and tribulated brother,
whose thou art and whom thou sincerely desires faithfully to serve,
and whose is the cause thou hast been and art concerned to uphold
(and no private ends or party whatsoever!) to thy dying breath.
And he is sufficient for his poor feeble servants in all their exercises and trials,
who feel but as the worms of the dust and unworthy of the least of all his tender goodness!
He ever will be all-sufficient to support, strengthen, comfort and preserve them,
and will get himself glory through them,
even if it seem best in his inscrutable wisdom it
should be through unparalleled afflictions!

If he saw meet that the Captain of our salvation should be made perfect through sufferings,
is it not enough for the disciples that they be as their Master?
And those who suffer the most for him are the most highly honored!
Nevertheless,
tender sympathy flows in the fellow-feelers towards such as are
thus peculiarly "`set for the defence of the gospel,`" and their
breathings do continually arise for their help and support,
as do ours at this time on thy behalf unto Him whose is the power,
and oh! that thou mayest be kept of him in peace to the end!

When it is well with thee crave the strengthening and preservation
of thy nearly united and affectionate friend,

My Dear Afflicted Friends,

I began this at home on first day evening,
but was prevented from proceeding with it until today.
I am now with my companion, S. Horner,
at the house of our dear friend Henry Neild at Frandley,
where our Monthly Meeting was held yesterday.
Since I left home on fourth day morning I have received in an envelope,
directed by thy hand I believe,
"`Two Letters`" (written by thee) "`in relation to the doctrines, order,
and usages of the Society of Friends,`" to which is appended a Contrast, etc.,
by another hand.
It seems very clear to me that any Friend, reading these letters,
must at once perceive that the ground of thy disownment has been
no other than thy faithful maintenance of the doctrines of Christianity,
as held by the Society from the beginning.

May the blessed Head of the church himself keep and sustain thee,
in every season of conflict and affliction, guide thee by his counsel,
and give thee wisdom to support the cause in which thou art engaged--wisdom
and skill which thy adversaries shall not be able to gainsay or resist.
This I trustfully believe will be the case, and that thou wilt be helped,
not only by thy own dear family and personal friends,
to place the whole matter and all the proceedings in their true light before the public,
but also that He who is strength in weakness,
to his poor dependent children who have no might of their own, riches in poverty,
and a very present helper in trouble,
will be near to thee and thine in all your afflictions--even
He who was with the three children in the fiery furnace,
and with his faithful Daniel in the lions`' den.

That it will yet be made manifest that the Lord has reserved and preserved
to himself a number comparable to the seven thousand in Israel,
who have not bowed the knee to Baal or kissed this, his image.
The Holy one will defend his own cause in his own time and way.
He will not give his glory to another, nor his praise to man`'s device.
He can and will bring down the tall cedars of Lebanon when he pleaseth,
and exalt his own little, lowly seed, and bring it into dominion,
to the glory of his own everlastingly glorious name.
Henry Neild requests his dear love given thee,
and wishes me to say he hopes thou wilt be strengthened to bear whatever is permitted
to come upon thee in consequence of the stand thou hast made against innovation.
Thou hast his near sympathy.

Dear Sarah Horner sends her love very affectionately.
Accept mine also, in which I am thy friend in tribulation,

My Dear Thomas,

I have thought a great deal about thee,
under thy accumulation of afflictions and trials of different kinds;
and some of them I know to be of no common order.
For it had become an uncommon thing, until recently,
to be persecuted for righteousness`' sake, even by the worst sort of people; but now,
the kindest of appellations has been so shamefully abused,
that some who still claim the name of Friends,
are found to have become so apostate from almost all that is good,
that their appetite for devouring the lambs of the
flock seems almost as keen as that of a Roman.

Well, my dear brother, the hotter the battle, if we meet it undauntedly,
and fight valiantly, as becomes good soldiers of our dear Lord and Master,
who himself was never foiled in battle, nor beaten in the field of strife,
the sooner will the end come.
He will always cover the heads of those who fight with him,
in the ranks of his own appointment,
and give them an armor which the fiery darts of Satan`'s army can never penetrate,
to destroy the inward life.
Blessed be his name!
Let us thank him, and take courage; for he will yet, if we cast not away the shield,
make us to rejoice, yea even to shout in victory over all our souls`' enemies!

Our Gurneyite overseers have sent to Greenwich, through their Preparative Meeting,
a complaint against what they call "`a disowned member,`"
for sitting at the head of the meeting,
and for speaking therein; desiring the advice and assistance of the Monthly Meeting,
in restoring Christian order, etc.;--this is as near as can be remembered.
And so we may expect soon a committee of much physical power--for restoring order?
No, but for introducing disorder,
by placing some of their sleeping monuments here at the head of the meeting.
For there is not one among them on the men`'s side, but sleeps much of the time,
when assembled, and they are often all asleep at the same time;
so that thou wilt readily see the disgrace that must attach to a Monthly
Meeting that places such men at the head of a meeting for solemn worship;
and painful will it be for all but themselves, to sit under such government;
and very few besides will likely meet with them.

My mouth has been opened but once, since Yearly Meeting, publicly;
and then they attempted to close the meeting as soon as I sat down,
in contempt of my service; and the Gurneyite men all went out; whilst Friends,
with a number of the neighbors present, kept their seats until a proper time to close;
by which they were apparently a good deal exasperated,
and consequently resorted to the measure above alluded to.

My wife joins me in dear love to thyself and wife, and all our dear friends,
who are resolved to follow on to know the Lord more perfectly,
though obtained only through this great fight of affliction.

My Dear Friend,

Well, inasmuch as I hesitate not in believing that the course
which I have taken was in the ordering of Truth,
so I trust that if I am favored to continue to keep a single eye to its pointing,
that He whom I have endeavored faithfully to serve, will still be with me,
and fulfill in me his whole purpose,
if anything yet remains for me to do before I go hence; and so I murmur not, nor repine,
on account of my condition,
but consider it preferable to that of being restored to such a body of false brethren.

I was not long since invited to attend a funeral, among other people,
at some distance from home; and feeling easy to do so, I went,
and in much clearness and freshness was raised up, in a very large gathering,
to testify of the way of life and salvation; and since,
I have attended our Western meeting,
and was livingly exercised in breaking bread to a little remnant of hungering minds,
to my own and their great consolation;
and I also had two family opportunities in the neighborhood, to the like satisfaction;
and subsequently had a public meeting, by appointment, at Kingston,
which is our county town, and was largely opened in testimony to a large company,
mostly Presbyterians, and some Baptists; and although the meeting was long,
I have rarely seen so large a gathering sit so solid and quiet.
It was, I believe, satisfactory to them, and truly,
peace and consolation were the fruits of that opportunity to my mind.
And I feel free to say to thee, my dear friend, that on such occasions,
as it always has been,
so it remains to be with me still,--to go to such meetings in fear
and trembling for the safety of the ark of Truth`'s testimonies.

It has been pretty clearly opened to me, that if life and strength continue,
considerable service will be, ere long, called for at my hands,
in different neighborhoods round about, as well as at some places more remote.
Our principles and testimonies, and the spreading of them among mankind,
never looked more desirable than at the present time;
and notwithstanding the great declension in these times,
I am disposed to accord with the views of dear Sarah Grubb, in England,
as well as some others of the like cast, that after a great sifting time,
there will be a greater gathering to our principles than
ever has been since the early days of the Society.

Under such a view as this,
I am encouraged to let the things which are now shaking the Society to its foundation,
pass over and be gone, and to look forward, trusting in the arm of the Almighty;
and believing that he will,
when he has spewed out of his mouth the hypocrites and the oppressors,
gather to himself a people that will serve him and honor him, and,
by the uprightness and purity of their lives,
as well as by the promulgation of the gospel in the
demonstration of the Spirit and with power,
give glory to his great and adorable name;
and in a manner which these adversaries of Truth can neither resist nor gainsay.
For the grievous transgressions of Israel, his hypocrisy, his idolatry, his oppression,
and the profaning of his sanctuary, the Lord has given him into the hand of Satan,
to buffet him, and to scatter him to the four winds of heaven.

But as it was said by the prophet, "`A remnant shall be saved.`"
And these, if they abide in his courts, shall be as seed sown in the earth,
and shall spring up and flourish, and he will cause them to spread forth,
as gardens by the riverside,
and will pour down the dayspring from on high into their bosoms,
and they shall walk in the light of life,
and power shall be given them to tread on serpents and scorpions, and receive no harm.
Oh! my dear friend, what cause of encouragement goeth forth under such views as these,
even while the darkest cloud overshadows us.
Such a day as this was foreseen by dear Mary Ridgway, some fifty years ago.
An aged Friend with us, whose memory is remarkable of things in olden time, says,
that she came into the men`'s Yearly Meeting at Newport, and addressed it as follows:
"`Friends, I have had a prospect that has borne very heavy upon my mind,
and which I feel constrained to communicate to this meeting.
I have seen the blackest and thickest cloud that I ever saw, hang over New England.
And I desire Friends to be on their guard, and to get to their watch-tower,
for I believe there is a sifting time coming;
and such trials as have never been before in this land,
will surely come upon this people.`"

Mary Peisley speaks of a reformation in the Society of Friends,--of
advancing in the principles of early Friends,
and speaks of some in the following manner: "`Instead of going forward,
they have looked back, and even sunk below the standard of the first reformers.`"
And says again:
"`And those who will be the instruments to labor
for a reformation in this degenerate age,
must find a difference in their trials from the sons of the former morning;
they will be of a more severe and piercing kind.
Theirs were from the world, and such as might be expected;
our trials will chiefly arise from those under the same profession,
clothed with the spirit of this world, though under disguise.
God will divide in Jacob, and scatter in Israel,
before that reformation is brought about which he designs.`"
And these prophecies, I apprehend, include both as one,
the troubles which began with you some years ago, and those which now afflict the church;
and although the characteristic is changed, the spirit,
just as thou told me in a former letter,
is the same,--it is the spirit of the destroying angel.
Thomas Shillitoe also testified of a grievous sifting time in our Yearly Meeting,
the same in substance as Mary Ridgway,
and seemed to lay the responsibility upon a spurious ministry,
now seen to be literally correct.

Dear Ann Jones, in a late letter,
encourages our publishing a statement of the wrongs which
we have received at the hands of our opposers in New England,
which, as far as I can hear, will be agreeable to all sound Friends in this country.

My Dear Thomas,

In my letter to John Pease, I mentioned that a friend to him as well as me,
had proposed that he should be put in a way of more information, etc.,
and as I had had no personal opportunity, I resorted to pen and paper;
informing him that the complainants were not able to make so much
as a breach of one paragraph of our discipline to bear upon me;
but that in the progress of their proceedings, they had violated it at least ten times;
and further told him, that our Yearly Meeting itself, by sanctioning those proceedings,
had virtually trodden down and destroyed its own discipline, etc.
In his answer, he informed me, that both himself and companion had read my letter,
each twice over,
and he thought best to read it to a select number of the Yearly Meeting`'s committee.
He says, they in a few words disapproved of every part of it,
and of that part which said,
I was disowned without discipline--that they said
they took altogether a different view of it, etc.
And so J. P. excuses himself from entering into judgment upon the merits of the case.

Well, now, my dear brother Thomas,
I am not at all disappointed nor surprised at thy manner of writing in relation to thyself;
however tender the feeling,
and deep the commiseration which I feel towards thee and for thee,
with fervent prayers that thou may not be left to cast away the shield as though it
had never been anointed,--though very near have I myself been brought to it many times.
Hast thou not often read of the deep baptisms, desertions, and sore conflicts,
if not misgivings, of those whom the blessed Master had chosen to publish his gospel,
and qualified by living experience of their own,
to administer fitly to the condition of those who are in bonds and in
prison for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus?

And as there never has been such a time as this in our Society,
nor even in the world at large in relation to the divine purposes,
and the condition of Christianity,
nor the field of harvest so white perhaps before the laborers;
there is proportionably greater need of the laborers and messengers
being entirely bereft of everything pertaining to the flesh--everything
of their own--and to be entirely clad with the pure white linen,
the covering of the Lord`'s own holy, blessed Spirit.
And these new garments cannot be so advantageously worn,
whilst some of the old ones remain upon us, nor yet so consistently.
Oh, then, I yet keep desiring for myself,
that I may patiently and so willingly endure the purgations of the waters of Jordan,
which is judgment, that all which pertains to Esau, the first-born,
may be wholly taken away,
even if it should require long and fearful standing in the very bottom of that river.

In much near and dear love and affection to you all,
and all the honest-hearted on that island, I am thine,

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

I felt greatly obliged to thee for thy interesting
account of the last sickness and close of that dear,
devoted, and undaunted servant of the Lord, Alice Knight.
Precious, indeed, is her memory to me!
And as Mary Penington said concerning her husband, that she ascended with him,
and saw him safely landed and gathered to a mansion of everlasting rest, joy, and peace,
so, with an eye of living faith and gospel assurance, methinks I see her purified spirit,
glorified and dignified in the presence of her holy Redeemer in heaven,
to go no more out.
Of him she was not ashamed, nor afraid to confess his blessed name among men;
nor did she flinch, for fear of man,
from delivering the message and whole counsel of God committed into her hands for others.

Henceforth, saith the Spirit, blessed are the dead who die in the Lord,
(and this precious handmaid was one of them,) yea, they shall rest from their labors,
and their works do follow them.
Yea, their faithful works shall follow them as a sweet testimony and memorial before God,
and that innumerable company of angels and the spirits of just men made perfect,
in the kingdom of Him who redeemed them with his own blood!
In comparison with this blessed assurance of the happy death and heavenly
ascension of the faithful and tribulated servants of the Lord,
everything of a sublunary character sinks down to nothing and vanity!

How great, then, the work of contributing to such a result;
and how happy the knowledge of the right way for such contribution!
Instead of calling people to Christ and him crucified,
the wisdom of God and the power of God,
how many are the teachers which mankind have heaped to themselves,
having itching ears to hear the devices or the divining
of men learned and skilled in earthly wisdom,
in hewing out cisterns, and making substitutes beautiful to the eye,
and pleasing to the ear, and gratifying to the carnal mind and will of man!
And thus the people are grievously led to mistake the image and likeness
of a thing (of immense importance) for the thing itself.

Oh, the responsibility that rests even upon those whom God has
called and anointed to direct his people in the true way;
even in the way heavenward!
And, on the other hand, how reprehensible are those who,
knowing nothing themselves of the way everlasting, and having nothing,
can therefore give nothing that has life in it, but are exhibiting a poor,
lifeless substitute, causing the people to mistake it for the right thing,
to trust in it, and to risk their all upon it, when,
alas! woeful disappointment must follow!

And what a grievous thing it would be, if the testimony to a living ministry,
through the dispensation of the good Spirit, should be lost in the world;
and more especially lamentable,
if we who have witnessed the descending of its heavenly dew,
should return again to the weak and beggarly elements, and through carnal indulgence,
and inattention to the Divine gift,
and an unwillingness to endure the only preparation for it, of the Holy Ghost and fire,
should make shipwreck of the faith of the gospel of our Lord and Saviour,
vouchsafed to our fathers, and even unto us who are here alive this day.
How much cause have we, therefore, to pray to the Father,
that he would raise up and anoint and send forth,
(in this day of fainting and of turning backward,)
many living and faithful laborers into his harvest.
If his arm is not made bare in some such marvellous way, for poor New England,
it does seem that his testimonies must fall to the ground in many of our streets,
and be trodden under the feet of men.

A faithful, livingly concerned Friend, in this day, is a treasure of great value.
May the Lord increase their number, and strengthen their hands,
to work effectually in his vineyard;
so that our eyes fail not in weeping for those who are gathered home,
or rather for the loss of them, from their ranks in the Lord`'s army!

Farewell.
From thy affectionate, though tribulated friend,

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

There are so many amongst us who cannot discern through things--they seem as if they
could feel no difference between a lecture-like discourse and a true gospel testimony;
and, moreover,
if that discourse is mingled with much of words about ancient times and doctrines,
they think it must be in unison with our ancient views, or the doctrines of Truth;
whereas, such a discourse is defective in life and power, and makes nothing perfect,
(as it were,) not being a true testimony unto and for Christ and his spiritual kingdom.
Now, there are divers of these laborers amongst us in the mixture,
and I fear their hands will be strengthened; these are large in words,
and very active in running to and fro,
so that there is hardly a possibility of escaping
coming in contact with them and being hindered!

And there is also a great stirring up of elders of latter
years to deal with those who hold forth the ancient doctrines,
so that the little remnant of these last are often much discouraged and shut up,
like as being in prison, and cannot come forth as fully as would otherwise be;
for the fields are white unto harvest,
and many are the seeking and visited minds up and down, but,
alas! when at our meetings they are too often fed with such
doctrines as they can hear from their own preachers,
and they even say so to some of us to our grief!
So that we may truly say, "`Truth is fallen in our streets,
and righteousness cannot enter!`"

I am, in the fellowship of the gospel, thy affectionate friend,

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend Ezra Comfort,

I received in due time thy last letter,
and will inform thee that it was truly satisfactory; and I apprehend that thou hast been,
previous to the arrival of this,
informed of the proceedings which have transpired in Rhode Island since that time,
such as the sustaining of the Quarterly Meeting of Friends,
and all the Monthly Meetings thereto belonging, with the meeting for worship at Newport,
distinct from the defective party; and last first day for the first time at Hopkinton,
in that part of the house unoccupied, we were, for once,
permitted to sit quietly under our own vine and fig-tree; but since,
that part has been made fast against us,
so that on fifth day we met at the nearest Friend`'s house,
which was that of my son-in-law, Thomas Foster; but where our meeting will be settled,
will not be decided until our next Monthly Meeting.

The church in old England, in early times, although greatly persecuted,
always had her able advocates, who sustained her testimonies,
both through the press and in the gallery.
But the church in New England, alas! can hardly be said, at this time,
to be favored with either!
Who can forbear to bemoan her condition?
Could the church in those former days, united as she was,
have sustained those testimonies to that honorable extent, without the means alluded to?
Or could she have done so, by the one without the other,
even if her choice of the two were allowed her?
Would a Fox, a Penn, or a Barclay,
if such there were in this day in any part of the heritage,
suffer an abused and violated discipline to deter them from
faithfully exposing such heresy as now prevails in New England,
both with the tongue and with the pen?
Or would they spare the authors of that heresy, or the violators of our discipline,
if irreclaimable, let the professions of such be what they may?
If the discipline could not be exercised to reach them,
would not those worthies resort to that which would supply its place,
in testifying against them?

Oh! my dear friend,
I tremble for the safety and success of our little solitary
remnant;--not so much from the smallness of the number,
as for fear it may not continue stayed upon the Rock of Ages!
Great danger awaits us, lest, in the bustle and commotion, lest,
in the strife of tongues, that which has been committed to us make its escape,
and thereby the Divine purpose, in sifting out this people, be lost,
through our lack of keeping down individually to the holy witness for God in ourselves.
And besides this, though our whole number will be very small, yet, of this remnant,
there are some, who are far from being clear of the leaven of this world.
How much cause there is for the few servants and handmaidens,
who may be favored to make good their escape,
to lift up their hearts in prayers and intercessions to God,
that he would deign to help us with a blessing from Mount Zion,
seeing there is none other hand that can gather us to the holy
standard of everlasting righteousness,--seeing there is none other
name that can prosper our cause (which is his) among the nations.

In much love to thyself and wife, and all our dear friends,
in which my wife unites with me, I conclude as ever thy friend,
in the covenant of the everlasting gospel,

My Dear Friend,

I suppose thou hast seen brother J.`'s letter,
in which he proposes that the Quarterly Meeting should
publish a statement of the Swanzey affair,
addressed to individuals, and for the information of the other Quarterly Meetings,
through them.
He seems to think,
as this was in the first instance an attempt to disown
a member for calling J. J. Gurney`'s books unsound,
that it is not only a very strong case in itself,
but that it would have a powerful effect in opening the eyes of the people,
and in disproving the charge that thou art the cause of all the difficulty,
as thou hadst no part in it, and thy name, of course, would not appear.

I must say that I think well of the Quarterly Meeting
publishing at least a simple statement of facts.
I never approved of the hurried way in which they finished their business and adjourned,
the last quarter; the circumstances were then, and are now, very peculiar;
and I did think that Friends should have taken more time,
and have entered more fully into a serious and weighty consideration of,
and investigation into the state of things, under the direction of best wisdom,
in order that they might have been favored unitedly to see what was required of them.
But we have got so accustomed to a formal lifeless round, and beaten track of things,
that it is difficult to get out of it, or perhaps to receive anything beyond it.
We have felt much solid satisfaction and comfort
in the attendance of our religious meetings;
several of them have been mercifully owned in a remarkable manner,
though held in silence until last first day; when He who openeth and none can shut,
set before me an open door,
and there was much brokenness apparent in several who were in attendance;
and it was truly one of those seasons for which we have cause to be thankful,
and from which we may take courage,
notwithstanding the increasing rage of our adversaries,
who would fain control that which is beyond them; for they, even they, are limited.

I cannot go much farther, for it is one o`'clock,
and this is the second letter I have written this evening.
I do wish thou wouldst come over and sit with us in our meetings.
The weight of things, as thou must see, rests heavily upon a few,
and the responsibility is great; which I would gladly divide, and more too.
But I can truly say, I find the cross as great as ever,
and a deeply settled aversion and unwillingness to take it up, as strong; still,
there is something which compels; and it feels increasingly constraining and diffusive.
But lest I go too far, I will not add more, even to thee,
whom I look upon as a father indeed; and in the scarcity of such,
perhaps thou wilt excuse the simplicity and freedom of a little child,
and believe me to be, in all sincerity, truly thine with love unchanged,

My Very Dear And Much Esteemed
Friend John Wilbur,

I received thy very acceptable present, and, after reading it,
I can say it is a very satisfactory work;
the publication of such proceedings as have been carried on in your land, will, I think,
be very useful now, in the present state of society, as well as to posterity.
I think we have never had so full a history of the workings of an out-going spirit,
as the one thou hast preserved and published.
I have no doubt there always has been a striking similarity of persons
and conduct in all these rents that have ever been made in our Society,
and probably it will be so, if there should be the like in ages to come.
The same evil spirit always produces the same evil fruits.
It is true that the tree is always known by its fruit.
Such clear, manifest, shameless, evil conduct, I apprehend,
has never before been committed by any professing our name;
and its public exposure at the present time, will, I hope,
be a blessing to society at large.
Thy very feeling introductory and concluding remarks
must reach the witness in every heart,
if it has not, previously, been crucified and slain.
But oh, what awful darkness must such be plunged into,
before they could commit these cruel outrages against the Truth!
May it be a solemn warning to all who are yet favored with the light,
and are standing in it, to take heed lest they fall.
I believe it has always been those who have been
the most eminently gifted and favored instruments,
when they depart from the way of life, and become exalted,
for want of keeping the body under, that become the greatest enemies of Truth;
and there are none others that so grievously afflict the church of Christ.

I understand thy book has been much called for,
and is likely to be freely circulated amongst us--I hope to profit.
Oh! my dear friend, thy sufferings and labors have been very great for thy divine Master;
and thy reward of peace is, no doubt, in proportion.
Whether thou lives, or not, to see the fruits of thy labors and sufferings,
they will assuredly be blessed, not only to thyself, in the enjoyment of great peace,
but also to the Lord`'s heritage.
These things which we have to pass through at the present time,
are not permitted to come upon us for naught.
Oh, what a mass of corruption there is, and has been, amongst us as a people!
If this dispensation of deep suffering will only have its perfect work,
in separating the precious from the vile, I have thought it will be light,
in comparison with the joy that the church will witness, when Truth will reign over all,
as in ancient days, in its wonted goodness and dominion.

Then truly we may say, as Moses said, "`Happy art thou, O Israel!
Who is like unto thee!
A people saved by the Lord; thy enemies shall be found liars unto thee,
and thou shalt tread upon their high places.`"
But oh, how is it now?
Our Israel is, and has for a long time, been in sore bondage.
I was in hopes, after the sifting we passed through, we should have seen better days,
but my hopes were soon lost, as to the time of our deliverance having yet come;
for I saw many going to build a tower--a Babel,
to save us from another deluge--and I labored against it,
and have been lightly esteemed by many, for opposing so great and good a work;
but it is a branch of the same corrupt tree,
yet it is cloaked under an extended religious education.

Our children are to be taught religion at schools, or by parents, as a science;
as if it could be obtained by human acquirements.
A great good is to be gained by our committing the Scriptures to memory,
that we may be ready, at all times, when asked,
to give an account of the hope that is in us.
There have a few pamphlets lately come into this country,
containing three letters of our late esteemed John Barclay of England,
which very fully unmask that kind of education, and has greatly relieved my mind.
I think if there could be an edition printed here, it would be very useful,
but I understand his old-fashioned views and doctrines are thought by many not
proper to be held up to view in this enlightened and advanced day--and by some,
at whom I am astonished--but, alas! whenever I hear it held up that we are,
or must become, more advanced in light and knowledge, and that it will not do to use,
in the present day,
the same plainness or severity of language in our speaking or writing,
as was used by our early Friends, I am ready to conclude that such,
let them be who they may, are not advancing in the right, but are in a downward course.

It is much to be feared that, under this view of the state of things amongst us,
there is much suffering yet to be passed through, before we, as a people,
shall witness that glorious day that was known in the early time of our Society.
They were then an inward and spiritually minded people,
all walking by the same rule and minding the same thing, in great humility and fear;
then the heavenly unity abounded, to their unspeakable joy.
I understand the Gurneyites have disowned sound Friends generally,
within the limits of Rhode Island Quarter,
and are forcibly keeping them out of their meetinghouses.
No doubt they intend to keep them out of the Yearly Meeting.
If this should be the case, it may all work together for good.

There is nothing that confounds that out-going spirit more than a manifested
meek and quiet spirit--this gives them no fuel to feed their fire,
without which they are in torment.
That which is the enjoyment of the righteous, is their torment.
I speak my views in simplicity to thee, as a brother, for I feel much interested,
as though I was one, mingling with you, and I doubt not,
as your eye is kept single to the great Head of his church--as I think
there is ground to hope has hitherto been the case--you will,
in all things, be directed aright.
I think our dear suffering Friends with you have been mercifully helped, so far,
to pursue their course through much deep affliction and trial.

There is great encouragement to press forward through every crowd of opposition,
to the Truth, until it obtains the glorious victory, which it always has, and ever will,
in the end.
It appears to me there is, and will be,
so much opportunity of knowledge throughout the limits of your Yearly Meeting,
and so much time for inquiry, and there have been so many notorious outrages committed,
that such as are not prepared, by that time,
to join with you in the support of the Truth, will not, I apprehend, ever after, or,
if they should ever join you, be of much strength to you; so it was with us.
I rejoice, hoping the time is nigh come,
when you may again (although you may be but a little remnant) enjoy that quiet, peaceful,
heavenly fellowship that is witnessed in the church of Christ,
and can be found nowhere else.
That so it may be, is often the secret intercession of my soul;
and may I salute thee as a brother, or rather as a father,
in the living fellowship that may remain without end!

I desire affectionately to be remembered to all thy dear family, as if named, and,
as far as there is opportunity, to all our dear Friends;
tell them it is my desire they may not be too much
cast down at the prospect that is before them,
for He that is with them, and in them, is greater than all them that are without.

My Dear Afflicted Friend and Brother in the Bonds
and Tribulations of the Gospel of Christ Jesus,
our Lord,

"`Be of good cheer, it is I,
be not afraid,`" is a language which hath repeatedly presented to my mind,
of latter days, when thinking of thee,
and especially since I have had the opportunity of reading
and reflecting upon thy book--The Narrative and Exposition.
I have no doubt but it will be extensively read,
and have a tendency to open the eyes of many in this country and yours.
For a time, it seems to me, it will be something like leaven operating secretly here;
the high ones will be much opposed to it,
and the rulers and present leaders of the people will hush
things up and cry peace as long as they can,
but a shaking must take place.
The "`stone cut out of the mountain without hands`" will, in the appointed time,
break in pieces the great image.
The feet (the foundation) of the system, which is, at best,
but partly strong and partly broken,
and is not composed of materials that will adhere and unite, will be struck and broken,
when the whole structure must come down.

But when, or how long before this time may come, or how widely the desolation may extend,
through the unfaithfulness of those who ought to have come
up to the help of the Lord against the mighty,
it is not for us to say.
The Exposition being got out into circulation, will be a relief to thee.
Thou wilt feel, I doubt not, as thy letter to G. C. bears testimony,
sweet peace and rest to thy troubled spirit, in having done what thou couldst;
and I hope thou wilt be favored to leave the result to Him whose the cause is, and who,
in his own good time,
will arise for the help and deliverance of his oppressed seed and people.
Truly we have need of patience, that, after having done the Divine will,
we may receive the promise.

It would be very pleasant to me to hear of thy health, and thy dear wife`'s also,
being good, for your years; but whether bodily health be your portion or not,
I have no doubt but the Comforter will be very near to comfort you in all your afflictions,
in every hour of conflict and proving, to the end of your weary pilgrimage; and,
in the end, that an entrance will be abundantly administered to each of you,
into the everlasting kingdom of holiness and peace,
through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, to whom, with God, the Father,
be honor and glory forevermore--amen!

Thy dear daughter,
Phebe Foster`'s long and deeply interesting letter of the 28th of 9th mo.
last, I received on the 15th of 10th mo.
Had less infirmity and more ability been allotted for the employ,
inclination has not been wanting to write to thee and to her; but I have had a long,
dreary winter season since that day, outwardly and mentally.
Perhaps, if the watch had been more steadily maintained,
I might have had more sensible enjoyment of heavenly good;
though I daily feel that I am a partaker of many temporal and spiritual blessings,
far beyond my deserts.

My mind, or spirit, has frequently visited thee,
and thy dear family and faithful Friends in your Yearly Meeting, who are made willing,
through love to the blessed Master, to endure suffering and reproaches and afflictions,
for his name, and Truth, and testimonies`' sake.
Whether I write to thee or thine again or not, is of little importance.
May the Lord, in his tender mercy, keep us in his holy care and keeping,
from all the power of the enemy, and, in the end,
grant us the victory over all our soul`'s enemies,
through living faith in the all-conquering power of his well-beloved Son,
our holy Redeemer, to whom, with the Father, belong glory and honor,
thanksgiving and praise.

In the bonds and fellowship of the gospel of peace, farewell.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend John Wilbur,

Thy volume of proceedings has been delivered to me by an unknown hand,
with my name written on one of the blank pages, apparently in thy handwriting.
If thou art the sender thereof, I am much obliged for thy valuable present;
and still more do I feel myself indebted for thy lucid,
valiant exposure of those errors and doings which
have too long been a burden to many honest Friends.
Oh, it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God,
and an awful consideration to forsake his most holy Word, to deny his ever blessed,
living, eternal Truth, by attempting to reduce the same into a dead letter,
or in any way to deny the Lord`'s Christ.

I remember many years ago, when Beaconism, in a smouldering state,
had almost stultified the energies of our large meeting,
and three of us--comparatively strangers in it and to one another--had
to contest the whole body on subjects of vital importance;
we perceiving, before many others, that there was at work a deep,
secret scheme to undermine and subvert the true doctrines of Quakerism,
under the specious pretence of avoiding the dangerous errors of Hicksism,
and of evangelizing the whole town and neighborhood!
I well remember, with unfeigned thankfulness,
the coming forth of thy valuable "`Letters,`" just at the right juncture,
when they were most required to strengthen our doubting minds and
to confirm the secret feelings by which we were made very sensible,
not only of our own unworthiness and inability to
move rightly in our own wisdom and strength,
but that the head and heart amongst us were sadly sick.

By thy pamphlet, addressed to my cousin George Crosfield of Liverpool,
our vision was cleared to see that as you in America had, through unwatchfulness,
glided off the right foundation on one side,
even so we in this country were gradually slipping from
it in an opposite direction--both being the cunning,
cruel work of Abaddon.
You were all for Christ within,
to the neglect of the great sacrifice whereby we are put into a capacity to be saved,
and a slighting of the history as recorded in the Scriptures of Truth,
which were also disparaged by you; we, for "`Christ without`" and the history,
not caring much about the mystery of religion,
so that we could exalt the letter high enough,
even above the Spirit which gave forth the Scriptures most surely to be believed.
Hence, the kingdom of Christ becoming divided in both instances,
the enemy gained his point.

Thy personal presence in Manchester did not help us much.
The ruling powers of the synagogue took special care
to keep us crushed ones in the background,
out of sight,
and to check anything like an attempt to speak feelingly with ministers and strangers,
whom they hoped to win.
But thy "`Letters`" effected what these doctors denied;
and terribly they were vexed at them.
Since that memorable period, what a change has come over the scene!

The doctors, where are they?
Ministers, elders, overseers, members--numbering about one hundred grown persons,
the wealth and flower of our spacious meeting--have all broken off,
professedly on religious grounds; and yet our number, six hundred odd,
never seems to have been diminished in consequence of the separation!
The seceders, where are they now?
alas! many are in their graves!
Some are scattered as sheep having no shepherd,
wandering hither and thither like goats upon the mountains, but none have returned to us.
Their beautiful chapel in Grosvenor street, costing £4000,
has lately been sold to the Baptists for £2000; all are scattered,
even their high-sounding name, "`Evangelical Friends,`" has become extinct;
and they are not a people now, if ever they were a people distinct from others.

Finding that Beaconism in principle, though not then in name,
had taken deep root in the hidden soil, and was rancorous in spirit against us,
we often said one to another, in the depths of our sorrow, "`Oh,
that mine adversary would write a book,`" when lo! the Beacon came forth,
and many who had been blind before could then see;
but others continue blind and perverse to this day,
and I believe in their hearts and minds have adopted the same ism,
but beginning with a G.

I have read every syllable of thy book,
and am affected to find that men calling themselves Christians, nay,
highly-professing Christians of our name,
should so far forget themselves and the rules of common respectability as to descend,
as they have done,
into those acts of injustice and intolerance which should shame a heathen to commit.
I am lending the work to all my acquaintance who can appreciate it,
and on one of the fly leaves I have written the following inscription, viz:--

John Wilbur and his book.--The New Englanders may attempt a reply to this volume.
They may, and most likely will, put forth a vindication of their conduct,
and try to neutralize the statements made by this
dear persecuted Friend and able minister of the gospel.
One thing they cannot accomplish.
Do what they will, they cannot disturb the great groundwork,
the structure and superstructure of the case.
They can as easily change the skin of the Ethiopian, as alter the complexion of,
and make sound the unsound doctrines of Joseph John Gurney,
as they are palpably manifest in his writings.

This is my strong conviction on the perusal of this most interesting, extraordinary,
and highly important volume coupled with my previous knowledge of the works of J. J. G.

I consider thy separation grievous and extremely unjust,
but I reckon its importance to thyself of small moment compared
with the effect it will have in a Society point of view.
I consider the act as a lawless, reckless dash at the principle which unites us;
and all true Friends are concerned therein.
If one member suffer, then do all the living members and the living body suffer also.
Distance, rank, estimation in the world,
cannot destroy the sympathy of the members and of the body,
so long as Christ continues to be the head of his true church, which he ever will.

Wishing thee well in the true acceptation of the term,
I subscribe myself thy very affectionate friend,

My Dear Friend,

A long time has elapsed since I received thy acceptable reply to my letter,
which brought me, and others of thy friends here to whom I showed it (most of whom,
although personally unknown to thee,
are thy friends in the bonds of the gospel) into
near sympathy with thee in thy deep trials and provings;
and although I have not replied sooner, we have not abated in interest for thy welfare,
and in ardent desires that thy divine Master might
see meet to cover thy head in the day of battle,
and bring thee safely through,
with uncompromised integrity in his cause--and humbly thankful
to the most merciful Omnipotent are thy friends here,
(all of them,
so far as I know,) that he has been pleased to grant their
desire sooner and more fully than they had looked for.

I esteemed it very kind of thee to send me a copy of thy "`Narrative.`"
It came to hand the day before I left home for our Yearly Meeting and I took it with me,
and read a considerable portion of it while travelling,
and it was a great comfort to me to find thereby,
that thou and thy co-sufferers had been strengthened to undergo your trials,
and unjust deprivations, in a good degree of that Christian spirit, which,
alone can conquer without having cause of regret.
The "`Narrative`" opens up such a continuous scene of persecution and injustice,
as I should have thought it impossible for any members of our Society,
in their individual capacity, to carry forward;
but when we see it carried on by a committee of a large body of the Society,
and sanctioned by that body, it is really appalling;
and reminds one of the lamentation of the prophet Isaiah over the Lord`'s people,
or those whom he had chosen for his people, if they had kept his commandments:
"`Judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off:
for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter; yea, truth faileth,
and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey.`"

A circumstance occurred during Yearly Meeting time, which I may mention.
I called to see a minister residing in the vicinity of London,
favorably disposed to J. J. Gurney, where I met several other ministers and elders,
and the conversation turned upon the proceedings of Friends in New England in thy case;
when the Friend of the house expressed her sorrow for the disagreement,
and said that she "`had thought John Wilbur would
not have given his friends so much trouble.`"
I recommended to them to suspend their judgment until
they knew more of the facts of the case.
I said I was satisfied that John Wilbur was a very persecuted man,
and that the New England superior meetings,
and their committees had broken through the rules of the Society,
towards both him and his Monthly Meeting,
as would soon be known by a statement of facts which was published,
and already received in England.
The Friend of the house replied that she was sorry to hear that any such book was published;
I told her it was needful, to show the truth,
and that those New England meetings must disprove the statements in that book,
before they could establish their own credit.

These dividings and scatterings (the work of the wily adversary) in our Society,
are cause of deep proving, but,
if brethren will depart from what we have found to be the right way of the Lord,
it will not do to go with them,
although we may be left as the "`three hundred`" of the "`Thirty-two thousand;`" yet,
if our hearts are true to the Captain of our salvation, there is no cause for dismay.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend John Wilbur,

I think I can truly address thee as such in the fellowship of suffering.
I have just received and read what the Gurneyite
Yearly Meeting call a statement of facts,
in which they endeavor to cover and screen themselves from blame,
but by this endeavor they greatly expose themselves,
by showing their profession and conduct to be inconsistent
and irreconcilable with each other.
By their history of facts as they would call it,
they charge thee with being the whole cause of all
the disorders and difficulty amongst them,
and that it has all grown out of thy indulging in a spirit of detraction,
(just as I was falsely charged,) but when they come
to show wherein thou hast offended in this respect,
they show by their proceedings it has all grown out of thy declaring the
doctrinal views of J. J. Gurney as published by himself to be unsound,
and by doing so thou hast injured his character and hurt
his services as a minister of the Society of Friends,
for which they have dealt with and disowned thee,
at the same time denying that this is what they have disowned thee for.

Then they go about to justify and cover themselves under
the certificate granted J. J. G. by London Yearly Meeting,
thus tacitly acknowledging they will receive and
unite with a minister whom they know to be unsound,
if he carry such a certificate with him;
but if any should venture to say the views he has written and published himself,
are unsound, let them be ever so much so, it is the highest grade of detraction,
contrary to discipline and long established order,
and sufficient ground to disown them upon.

Thus, whilst endeavoring to justify their inconsistency,
and the base persecution they have been guilty of,
they have not considered that they are condemning
London Yearly Meeting in the case of Hannah Barnard,
and Philadelphia Yearly Meeting in the case of Elias Hicks,
but they take the same course against sound Friends,
and justify themselves in the very same way that the Hicksites did with us,
pretending to support good order,
whilst they were openly and barefacedly committing disorder,
and shamelessly and falsely charging sound Friends,
that were supporting the order of the Society,
with committing disorder--thus abundantly manifesting that they make lies their refuge,--and
we find by the history that has been preserved by the Society from its earliest period,
that when individuals or bodies have joined with those who were once in
the Truth and were favored instruments while they kept in it,
but who have apostatized, and departed from their first principles,
it has been wonderfully remarkable how these have all pursued
the same course and have made lies their refuge.

But oh, it was awfully shocking to me, after reading their so-called statement of facts,
to come to their pretended declaration of faith,
and then to see the monstrous absurdity of a body professing
to be a Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends,
giving J. J. Gurney a certificate expressive of its full
unity with him as a sound minister of our religious Society;
while yet the leading members of that body knew that
the sentiments he had published to the world,
were at variance with,
and in direct opposition to the doctrinal views of our early Friends,
and were the sole cause of uneasiness amongst them.
This being the case, they must unite with his unsound sentiments--then,
in order to screen themselves from the imputation of unsoundness,
they have issued a false declaration,--a solemn declaration that they
own and believe in doctrines which they know to be at variance with and
totally in opposition to those held and published by that man.

A way I think was marvellously opened for you to come out from amongst them;
and may all the praise be ascribed to Him who alone is able
to control all things according to his own will.
I think you have abundant cause further to trust
in the Arm of his divine power for future help.
We understand there is a deputation coming over from London
Yearly Meeting to settle difficulties amongst us--a high-handed,
unprecedented and uncalled for step.
I hope Friends will be aware of them--the unsoundness of
their members has been the cause of our difficulties.
Is it likely they will make things better by coming here,
unless divine Providence turn their efforts into a blessing?

He can control the designs of our enemies and make them a blessing to us,
which I hope will be done, as we keep our eye single to our divine Leader.
I received very encouraging and acceptable letters from Friends of Fall River and Nantucket,
giving an account of your proceedings at your Yearly Meeting and at Sandwich Quarter.
It has been truly grateful to my feelings that you have been favored to stand firm.
I have no doubt the course you have taken, is right,
and that you have embraced the right openings, and my dear friend,
how thankful I feel that thou art restored to thy rights and can mingle
again with thy dear friends in the bosom of the church.

It has often been my secret intercession that thou mightest live to see it.
Great and many have been and yet remain to be the burdens
which the upright in the Lord`'s house will have to bear,
and few to bear them.
No doubt thou, with myself, when viewing the mournful state of things,
hast been ready to intercede as the prophet did, when under the juniper tree,
"`Take away now my life, oh Lord, for I am not better than my fathers.`"
Ah, these fathers he alluded to had been taken away from all their
afflictions and had entered into their everlasting rest.
But may we continue, striving to keep in the everlasting patience,
and be favored to possess our souls in it until the Judge
of all the earth says "`it is enough,`" and stretches out
his hand of eternal power over the oppressors of his Israel,
and by his judgments, brings forth his people out of this furnace of affliction.
He will, in his own time, accomplish it,
and I marvel not if the child is born who will live to see
better times than any now living have yet seen;
and may he hasten the work he is about to do in the earth,
even if it is by his awful judgments,
to bring that day forth when the Lamb shall reign over all,
and give his followers the victory.

Things at present look but gloomy with us.
Everything that comes from the Gurneyites with you,
is eagerly sought for and circulated by many with us,
and by some of whom we might have thought better things;
yet we believe the eyes of some are opening, of latter times,
to see things as they really are.
We understand Rowland Green was advised, even by some of his friends about Burlington,
to return home, and we hear he did so.
Poor things, they will have a very hard path to tread,
whilst they continue to pursue the course they have taken,
by endeavoring to clear themselves of what they know they are justly charged with,
and to confirm the charges they have heaped upon the innocent,
which they know to be false.

Whilst I view them in this condition,
my mind is often brought into very solemn and awful feelings on their account.
Condemnation must surely waken up in their souls at times, showing them, by the light,
the condition they stand in, but they see no way of getting out of it with honor,
as they term it.
Ah, that is devilish honor, that when we have committed a fault,
we should commit another in order to hide the first, thereby to save our honor.
But oh, what will the end be!
May these pause before it is too late, saith my soul,
for opportunity will not always be granted.

Since writing the above I have read John Pease`'s address to Friends in America,
and was forcibly struck with his inconsistent views.
He professed whilst with us, to walk between the two parties, as he called them,
but I think in writing his address, he has openly put his foot into Gurneyism.
He acknowledges us to be in a mixed state,
then he warns us to beware of holding the Truth in parts; yet he says,
"`Take away one stone from the perfect arch and the whole structure will fall.`"
Then he states that in his travels he heard of false doctrines,
and departures from the Christian views of our forefathers,
and acknowledges that there may be slight shades of difference,
or a little dissonance of views, in the sentiments of many sincere and valuable Friends,
but which ought not to destroy the harmony of the body;
and declares he sees nothing that calls for a division.
He does not, however,
tell us what the slight departures from the testimonies of our forefathers are,
but falls to railing against some for bearing their testimonies against these departures,
when at the same time he acknowledges a departure
from them is like taking a key-stone from an arch,
that will occasion its fall.
Such, and many more are his irreconcilable inconsistencies.

With much love to thee, thy family and all thy dear suffering friends as if named,
I remain thy friend, Ezra Comfort.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

Taking a view of our Society at large, and of its lapsed condition,
great is the cause of mourning and lamentation, and, comparatively speaking,
the number few who lay it to heart in that deep anguish
of soul which the Lord`'s prophet Jeremiah felt,
when his people had so generally despised,
and departed from the covenant which the God of their fathers,
in the aboundings of his mercy and favor towards them,
had made with them in order that they might be a city of excellency among the nations;
in order that his great and holy name might be honored and glorified,
by the pitching and establishing of his sanctuary,
at least in and among one of the tribes of the inhabitants of the earth;
intending that the law should go forth of Zion and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

He on his own part,
fulfilled every tittle of that covenant of gracious promises unto them; yea,
and abundantly more than he promised did he do for that people,
by watching over them continually;
and as often as he saw in them a disposition to depart
from the testimonies of that covenant,
he called unto them, he reproved them, and in great mercy invited them,
and when they would not hear, he chastised them;
and finally their revoltings were so grievous in his sight,
that he suffered their enemies to carry them away into captivity,
to break down the walls of Jerusalem, and to burn her gates with fire,
and to profane his holy sanctuary in the midst of her!
And the stones which pertained to its excellency
to be poured out in the top of every street!

For these things the prophet wept, his eye ran down with water,
because the Comforter was far from him, because his people had become desolate,
and the enemy had prevailed!
But still there was a remnant left, there were a few of the poor of the land,
who were not carried away to Babylon; comparably as many, perhaps,
as are left in New England;
but oh! that it might not fare with these as it did
with those--that these may not go away into Egypt!
To avoid which, the keeping of his covenant is now as essential for this little remnant,
as it was in those days when Israel was brought out of Egypt;
as it was for that little remnant of the Lord`'s chosen, in George Fox`'s time;
for then the Devil came in on every side,
and was the most effectual in his devices where least expected,
bringing trouble into the camp of that little army
whom the Lord had enlisted and banded together,
to stand against the multitude of the mighty.

When Israel was delivered from Pharaoh and his army,
and had reached the shore of their deliverance from him,
then they praised the Lord in songs of thanksgiving,
not apparently thinking but their troubles were over;
not aware that as it related to themselves and their needful preparation,
through the Lord`'s judgments, for the accomplishment of that which he intended,
that the work was as yet but begun.
And touching this little army that has been mercifully delivered here in New England,
from the cruel hands of their enemies, by the stretching out of the Lord`'s arm,
and for which thanksgiving and praise are due to his great and ever blessed Name,
yet some of us rejoice but with trembling, lest,
through the unsanctified condition of some who escaped with us, and the enmity of Satan,
the testimony should not be exalted and honored,
as our holy Leader designs it should be.

My Dear Aged And Afflicted Friend And Brother, John Wilbur,

Thine of 7th mo., 14th,
was mine on the 30th. Its contents awakened afresh
the feeling of near and tender sympathy with thee,
thy wife and family, in the great and sudden loss of thy dear son,
but I trust that through redeeming mercy and lovingkindness,
your loss is his eternal gain.

The Yearly Meetings having passed over as they have done,
must necessarily have added to the discouragements and tribulations
of the little struggling remnant in New England.
But whilst the fearful, doubting, hesitating ones may be discouraged,
it may have this good effect,
to deter such as are not settled and established on the true foundation,
from connecting themselves with you.
I cannot believe that the sufferings of the faithful few, will be in vain,
as regards our poor, bewildered Society,
and certainly not as regards themselves in the Divine sight.
Notwithstanding the determination on the part of those who at present bear rule,
in many of the Yearly Meetings,
to cry "`peace,`" to keep all quiet and preserve the "`harmony,`"
he who brought this vine out of Egypt and Babylon,
spiritually, still hath regard to the living plant of his own right-hand planting,
and will no doubt succor, defend, and preserve the stock alive in the root,
though it may be for a time apparently trodden down by the wild boar of the forest.

Ah! what a degenerate, backsliding, worldly-minded,
worldly-blinded people we must have become,
before the ancient Truth and testimonies given us to bear could be thus slighted,
and turned from, and a counterfeit,
plausible and specious enough in its outside appearance, substituted for the real thing.
What is it, short of putting darkness for light,
and light for darkness--thus to forsake the ancient standard,
and substitute one in its stead that has not the Lord`'s stamp upon it.
Sorrowful indeed is the reflection, that our Yearly Meeting, the first that was gathered,
should be,
(or its present leaders and rulers,) among the foremost
to encourage that which has not its origin,
its foundation, in the ever blessed and unchangeable Truth; and yet,
like other apostate churches,
be willing to lay claim to the appellation of "`mother church.`"

Alas! for the day.
Well may the mourners in Zion cry, "`Spare thy people, O Lord,
and give not thine heritage to reproach.`"
Great are the efforts that are making with the busy, worldly-wise ones with you and us,
to bind up, and heal, and cry "`peace.`"
They may be permitted for wise purposes, unseen, unknown to us, to prevail for a time,
and the oppressed little ones, who have no strength of their own, may have to cry "`Oh,
Lord, how long?`"
but when he sees meet to take unto him his great power,
and show himself strong for his oppressed people, this daubing with untempered mortar,
and crying "`peace,`" where there is no peace,
will be seen to have been healing the hurt of the daughter of Zion slightly, deceitfully.
Hast thou Isaac Penington`'s works?
or hast thou read his description of Babylon?
Alas! how many are taking up their rest there,
and flattering themselves that they are inhabitants of Zion!
But the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and discover their works.

I have thought much of the little company in New England,
who are set for the defence of the gospel,
and desire their encouragement to faithfulness in
whatever is clearly manifested as their duty to do,
or to leave undone; and can but hope that before the Yearly Meetings come round again,
many will be induced to read the statements and declarations
put forth by the smaller body,
and be favored with clear discernment as to their individual duty.
In our Yearly Meeting there are many secret mourners,
many who are going heavily on their way because of the oppression of the enemy.
The great revealer, time,
will show whether any way will open for their relief at our next annual assembly.

One thing is certain, man is not his own keeper,
and those who have so far cast off the yoke and burst the bonds,
as to yield themselves to the government of their own human wisdom,
are likely to go further than they intended,
and to commit themselves in a way they did not foresee;
and whilst digging a pit for others, may fall into it.
Any information which thou or any of thy family incline to hand to me of your proceedings,
will be acceptable.
I have not heard of late anything respecting the movements of the English deputation,
now on your side of the water.
I can but think the one who visited America some years since
must now and then feel himself in a strait place.
I remember his saying to me when he was young,
that I. Penington`'s writings were like life to his life.
Were it so now, would he, could he be where he is?
I believe we must have a great shaking; that an awful storm is impending over our poor,
desolated, and once peaceful Society.
Much of the eighth chapter of Isaiah seems to me to apply to our present state,
"`Associate yourselves and ye shall be broken in pieces,`" etc.

There are many arrows in the sacred quiver,
and as Sarah Grubb said very significantly in our Yearly Meeting of ministers and elders,
in the beginning of Beaconism,
"`The Almighty did not send an army against the builders of Babel to destroy them,
but he confounded their language; they could not understand one another.
And thus I believe it will yet be with the wise Babel builders;
whilst to the despised and suffering little ones, the language is in full force,
'`Ye have need of patience, that after having done the Divine will,
ye may receive the promises.`'`"

If my life and memory be lengthened until the Yearly Meetings come round,
I shall be deeply interested in hearing what transpires at each one.
The blessed Head of his church may see meet to open and prepare
the way for the deliverance of his oppressed seed and people,
sooner than at present seems likely.
But to hold fast that which we have received, that no man take our crown,
seems to be nearly enough for some of us,
daily feeling that it is good both to hope and quietly wait "`for the salvation of God.`"
I am one of the poor and needy--remember me for good,
when thou art favored with access to the throne of grace.
Accept my love very affectionately, thyself, wife and children, and your faithful,
tribulated friends.
Dost thou hear from E. Hunt of late?
She is so intimate with H. C. B., who is so interwoven with,
or wrapped up in her cousin J. J. G.,
that one cannot look for much like genuine Quakerism in that quarter.

My Dear And Valued Friend,

There is a sad kind of infatuation attendant upon the generality,
and carefully fomented and cherished, that thou and thy friends are in a wrong spirit,
and therefore it is better not to touch any of your books,
nor to investigate the matter in the least, lest they should be defiled.
But I am glad there is an honest remnant, even among the younger sort,
who cannot sit down and thus swallow the opinions of others,
but must feel and see for themselves;
but these are but a few compared with the multitude who have loved other
lovers (than the blessed Truth) and after them will they choose to go,
loving ease to the flesh!

And now, my endeared friend and elder brother,
I have sorrowful news to convey to thee in the decease of that faithful, valiant,
and dignified servant of the Lord, dear Ann Jones,
who departed this life on the 14th of this month; but though painful to us to lose her,
it is her everlasting gain, and cause for rejoicing on her account.
She had been declining for several months,
but was preserved clear and bright to the last,
and the last words she was heard to utter were,
(only twenty minutes before the close,) "`Bring the chalcedony,
and the precious stones.`"
She testified to several friends who went to see her during the last ten days,
her unshaken belief in, and cleaving to our ancient gospel principles and testimonies,
and said that if ever she had done anything that was right in her life,
it had been to uphold them, and to expose that which would mar them; that, nevertheless,
she had nothing to boast of, and was sensible she was a very unprofitable servant,
and had fallen very short of what she ought to have been,
but her whole trust and confidence was in the love and mercy of God in Christ Jesus,
with more that I cannot recollect, evincing much deep humility, yet peaceful hope.

I felt constrained to give the last token of near and dear love and unity,
by attending the interment last week,
(though 220 miles off;) it was a mournful time to
the large gathering then assembled from various parts,
but worse than all, it was a painful time from the deluge of words in the mixture,
which now troubles us, go almost where we will!
One of her last acts was to revise the tract "`Is it Calumny, or, is it Truth?`"
and to contribute towards its spreading by post generally.

My breathings are poured forth for such in tender sympathy,
and how sweet is the remembrance of poor Hagar`'s
language for these solitary and afflicted ones,
"`Thou God seest me!`"
The dear +++_______+++ wish their love to thee,
I expect +++_______+++ will write soon--they share in thy letters to me always.
I am pleased to say they seem deepening in best feeling of late, to my great comfort,
especially.
But alas! for poor H+++_______+++, worse and worse!
O,
I expect we shall be still more and more called to sacrifice
and lose all that is very near to our affectionate feelings,
even the unity, and favor, and esteem of those who are very dear to us,
but he that loveth aught more than Christ is not worthy of him,
and I desire to be endued yet more and more with Paul`'s noble spirit,
who counted all but as dross and loss if so be he might win Christ and be found in him.
Farewell, my dear friend, in near and dear love.

I remain thy affectionate friend,

Lydia A. Barclay.

P+++.+++ S.--Our coming Yearly Meeting looks and feels very awful,
so that the prospect thereof weighs down some of our poor weak bodies.
The Lord help his poor oppressed ones, for if he help us not whence can we be helped;
it is in vain to look to the hills and the mountains,
but the true-hearted Israel may hope in him forever.
Breathe for our help, dear exercised friends!
Benj.
Seebohm is likely to be liberated to visit your land, but he will not come amongst you.
Oh, the compassing of sea and land, and the deluging of words now amongst us,
but those who preach in the mixture can do no other than
minister to the mixture and baptize into the mixture,
and thus the evil disease, by the linsey-woolsey garment, is increased,
and alas! is not the enemy`'s kingdom thereby promoted?

My Dear Friend And Brother, John Wilbur,

Not having for a long time received any communication from thee,
and feeling a continued flow of Christian fellowship towards thee,
I feel inclined to pen a few lines, although it is a time, with me, of much weakness,
both of body and mind.
My bodily health has long been on the decline,
and my mind often much borne down and depressed,
on account of that degenerating and apostatizing spirit, spreading amongst us;
and at the same time,
these very manifest apostates hypocritically profess to
unite with the doctrines of our worthy predecessors;
and when we point out to them their attempt to change
and set at naught our ancient doctrines and testimonies,
as is easily proved by their own writings,
they declare that doctrines have nothing to do with the
division and disunity that prevails throughout the Society,
but that it has all originated with a few individuals in New England,
who for their disorderly conduct have been justly disowned.

When the subject of these unsound books, written by members,
was before our Meeting for Sufferings, they were declared,
by a large portion of the meeting, to be very unsound,
while their supporters declared they knew of no such books; then it was asked,
what greater evidence we could have than was before us, that we,
even the members of that meeting, did not see alike,
as regards the fundamental doctrines of the Society.
Then one of the radicals cried out, they were charged with being unsound.
Another of them confessed that there were such books, and that he had no unity with them,
yet violently opposed our taking any notice of them,
saying they were not the cause of the disunity,
but it was on account of disciplinary proceedings.

Thus, thou may see, we have the very same deceptive spirit to contend with,
which you have in New England.
But oh, my dear friend, I am afraid, from what has appeared,
that these open opposers will not be the worst, with whom we shall have to contend,
but that it will be some of those who fill the most conspicuous stations,
and have had great influence in our Yearly Meeting,
and who joined their friends in declaring to our friends in Old England,
that the disunity and separation in our Society in this land,
was on account of unsoundness in doctrines published by
some of their members occupying high stations in Society,
but who now, for some cause unknown to me,
are not willing to hold up the same testimony to our Friends at large,
neither are they willing to own you as brethren in Christian fellowship with us;
but of late, are trying to find some fault against you in some of your proceedings,
which I fear is spreading an influence against you without a cause; and of course,
against some of us who have borne an open testimony
of unity with you and your proceedings.

I am unable to find out, even by conversing with them,
what the object is at which they are aiming,
unless it is a hope that some way will open to bring
about a compromise without any further separation,
which they seem greatly to fear;
but my testimony to them is that a separation has taken
place in the very fundamental ground of our Christian faith;
and this being the case,
the sooner we are separated from each other in profession the better,
for the very ground of true unity is broken up.
Truly it may be said, "`How has the gold become dim, and the most fine gold changed!`"
Some of those who stood firm against Hicksism are now giving their strength to Gurneyism,
which I think is a no less departure from the Truth.

They are now charging some of us with a fiery zeal
which will be the means of driving many from us,
saying that we must exercise patience and forbearance;
and latterly are charging Friends with having acted
under too much fiery zeal in the time of Hicksism,
which was a cause of driving away many from us.
Thus they have entirely changed their views, to my knowledge;
at that time their sentiments were with my own, which were, and remain to be that,
had there been a more early and faithful zeal maintained,
to put their feet upon the neck of that spirit of infidelity,
it then would have been the saving of many; and surely if,
when Gurney first came out with his anti-christian publications,
Friends had borne a firm and unflinching testimony against them,
there would then have been a very different state of things from what there is now;
and it does appear to me, that unless there is a great change in some,
our greatest suffering will arise from a quarter, in time past the least suspected.

When we look ahead, the prospect to some of us looks very gloomy;
yet if it is permitted that we shall be closely tried and sifted, may we not hope that,
after all the reprobate silver is clean removed out of Zion,
it may shine with its ancient brightness!
Therefore let us hope that all things will work together for good.
My very soul`'s desire for my dear Friends in New England is,
that they may abide in the patience and not look too much out to other bodies,
but look to our holy Head.
If this continues to be the case, I am sometimes ready to think that,
with all your trials and weakness,
(which are despised by some,) there may yet be found
more strength within your limits than within ours;
although by some among us, ours has been much boasted of.

I understand a member of our city has requested thee to
return to him all the letters he has written to thee.
What does it mean?
Does he suppose thou art a changed man, or is he a changed man?
What is he afraid of?
If he has written to thee what he continues to believe are sound truths,
why is he afraid they should be made use of?
If he has changed his views, then he has cause to fear he may one day be exposed.
If thou hast complied with his request,
I would query whether it would not be right for thee to demand
those thou hast written him in time past in confidence,
showing that the course he has pursued has shaken thy confidence in him;
if thou hast not returned his,
I would have thee think seriously about it before doing so.
There may something arise out of it in future that may be of serious moment.^
footnote:[The request here spoken of was for the destruction of the letters alluded to,
and not for their return.
It was not, however, complied with.]

Since writing the above, I have heard some propositions held up,
of your corning together, by one of our city members.
These were for the Gurneyites to throw down the hatchet,
restore John Wilbur to all the rights he had before he was disowned, etc.,
and then for you to return to them again.
This shows where some of our leading members stand.
If such a step should be taken,
what would become of the noble and dignified testimony which you have
borne against that apostatizing spirit that is spreading amongst us?
and does it not show that those who hold up these ideas have no testimony against it?
Nay, assuredly you will never be caught in such a snare;
for some of your lives have been in the Truth, and in its righteous testimonies,
and you have suffered deeply for them; can any feeling mind suppose, for a moment,
that you have become so lost to any sense of good,
as to leave the Truth and those who stand in it,
and join in fellowship with the apostates?

Thus, my dear friend, I have written a little of the feeling exercise of my mind,
believing thou canst sympathize and feel with me.
Please write soon, and give me some information as to how you are getting along.
I am much with you in spirit, which I trust is the case with you concerning our welfare,
seeing the precious Truth that is near and dear to us, is one.
Please receive my best love, which I trust is in the heavenly fellowship,
with thy dear wife and tender offspring,
and I wish to be remembered to all my dear friends with you, as opportunity may offer,
and when we are favored to approach the throne of Divine mercy,
may our remembrance of each other be mutual.

So I rest, I trust, in that which changeth not,

Portland, 9th mo., 8th, 1846.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend Nathan Douglas,

Since being in these parts I have felt a strong attraction towards thee,
out of which has grown a desire to see thee,
and I have been nearly on the point of setting out to go to thy house,
but recollecting that Falmouth Quarterly Meeting would be convened about this time,
and that more probably thyself and other Friends
whom I had a desire to see may have gone thither,
I changed my mind from going, to the expedient of writing thee.
Thou wilt readily recollect thy own conscientious
uneasiness with the doctrines of J. J. Gurney,
and the sentiment that their direct tendency was
to sap and lay waste the doctrines of Friends,
and with what fervency thou exhorted me to be encouraged to hold fast
and keep good the stand which I had taken against those doctrines.

This testimony of thine was truly comforting and
strengthening to my tried and afflicted spirit.
Knowing that it was taken in the integrity of my heart,
and fully satisfied also that such a stand against the danger
that awaited the church was in Truth`'s direction,
I could no more be persuaded to abandon the upholding of our principles and testimonies,
nor to refrain from witnessing against those of a contrary tendency,
than could George Fox and other Friends in his day.
And the day had again come in which the principles of Friends
could no more be sustained without controverting their opposites,
than they could in his time; and the necessity was now the more imperious,
by reason that the advocates of defective sentiments had sprung
up from among ourselves--from amongst the great and the influential,
and men who had great power over the general mass of our Society,
as foretold by Mary Peisley;
a condition similar to that of the church in the third and fourth centuries.

Then it was that the mighty influence and power of
the great men in the church prevailed over,
and put to silence such men as thou and I. Their concern was of almost infinite
importance for the saving of the church from the grievous apostasy that ensued,
and so by the overcoming of such concern for her safety, the best body,
as we may well believe, that ever existed,
was compelled to receive such doctrines and conform to such
practices as destroyed all but the name of a Christian church,
and so these new doctrines that are now offered to the church
under our name and which are already subscribed to by the
whole Gurney party in England and increasingly so in America,
will have as direct a tendency to bring us into an apostate condition; yes,
and without some miraculous interposition of Almighty Power,
the whole body of those who continue to support the Gurney party,
must as surely fall into an apostate condition as did the primitive Christians.

Some of the leaders of the Gurney party in the eastern Quarters have within
a few days acknowledged to me their full unity with J. J. Gurney;
and I was told by an apparently honest man among them,
that he hears no fault found with him by any of the
Friends with whom he is acquainted in Fairfield Quarter.
And perhaps thou knowest that George Jones`'s and Thomas Shillitoe`'s testimonies
are that J. J. G.`'s principles are nearer to those of other professors,
than to Friends,
and that this opinion is candidly corroborated by Ralph
Wardlaw and other eminent writers out of our Society.
And if thou hast read the writings of J. J. G. generally,
thy own knowledge of Friends`' principles,
and ability to draw a contrast will plainly show thee the utter
inconsistency of many of his doctrines with those of Friends.

And I suppose also,
thou knowest that the leaders of our Yearly Meeting and their adherents have overrun
in a most flagrant and disorderly manner the bounds and landmarks of our discipline,
and the order of Society rather than not sustain the man and his doctrines,
by prostrating the dearest rights of many of those who could
not with peace of mind compromise their principles,
nor forbear to testify against such things as tend to their overthrow.
Thou knowest too, I apprehend,
that these leaders among us caused J. J. G.`'s credentials
to be indorsed in our Yearly Meeting,
and have also subscribed to a written document in which they defend him with great earnestness,
and allude to him as a duly accredited and fully authenticated
minister of the Society of Friends.

Nor canst thou be a stranger to the cautions, exertions,
and injunctions that are pressed upon their members at large,
against reading or receiving any books, documents, papers, or letters,
that will expose or bring to light their faith in false
doctrines or their disorderly and cruel proceedings,
as above alluded to.
And yet thou, even thou, my dear Nathan, art claimed by them, as I understand,
to be one of their number, and now consenting to, if not approving of their proceedings,
and therefore making thyself responsible for those measures to which they have resorted.

But, my dear friend,
I am not yet prepared to believe that thou hast given thyself up to indorse such
unhallowed proceedings and persecutions against honest and conscientious Friends,
who dare not run to do evil, though it were with a great multitude,
but would rather sit alone and be silent at the feet of their divine Master;
or arise and fight single-handed under his banner as their lot may be ordered of him.
Oh! remember there was one among that little number that were called martyrs,
whose zeal might perhaps have exceeded his knowledge, and who,
in order to obtain credence with the great body, did, in an unguarded hour,
and through human weakness,
subscribe to a recantation of his course in support of pure Christianity!

But, alas, his peace with his God was destroyed,
nor could he with all the sagacity he was master of,
mend up that great breach of conscience so deadly to good enjoyment until he returned
to his former course of bearing witness against the enormities of the church,--the body.
Nor could the plaudit of bishops or cardinals in commendation of his recantation,
restore his troubled soul with peace to God,
until he again resumed his integrity and renewed
his testimony against the errors of the church;
then he died at the stake with great peace,
glorifying that God who had thus restored him to his allegiance to him.

I charge thee, therefore, beloved, by the mercies of the Lord,
to return to a full acknowledgment of thy allegiance
to the glorious and dignified testimonies of Truth,
and never to give thy strength in any way to that spirit which cometh from the wilderness,
and would little by little corrupt and destroy the heritage of God,
at the same time pleading for unity and harmony of concert in the most plausible manner.
But alas, alas, for a unity of many in the promotion of a cause which is not of the Lord,
and which tendeth to the gainsaying and perverting of the doctrines of the gospel!

It is a saying that cannot be refuted, that the greater the number,
and the more noted the men that are united in supporting errors in the church,
the greater the harm and danger which awaits the Lord`'s cause,
for thereby the innocent ones up and down among the
people are the more strongly bound to the hierarchy,
and to the usurpation of those that have placed themselves in Moses`' seat,
but are not of the Lord`'s anointing; the exposure of whom,
simply in Truth`'s direction and according to knowledge,
can never hurt the oil or the wine, nor yet break the true unity in the love of Christ,
which is a blessed attribute going hand in hand with
that judgment which purifieth the heart of man,
and delivers his church and people from all the delusions of the wicked one.

Hence the agreement of all the Divine attributes,
among which is the light of the Sun of Righteousness,
which driveth away all darkness and shineth most gloriously in
the firmament of God`'s kingdom,--to which I commend thee,
my dear friend, with my own soul,
so that nothing pertaining to our own good and to
the good of this people may be hid from our eyes.
Farewell.

Hopkinton, 9th mo., 29th, 1846.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

Thou wast not mistaken in thy apprehensions of my feelings when I wrote thee from Salem;
not having forgotten the bitterness of the baptisms
of which it was our lot to drink largely last year,
I could not promise myself a great measure of consolation
in going over the same ground again;
yet the conflict was not now altogether so deeply painful as then.
Inasmuch as the members of our Society down in that northeastern country
have been so entirely excluded from the true knowledge of the great question
in controversy whereby our Society has been torn to pieces,
a considerable portion of my concern was,
that they and their sober neighbors might be apprised of our concern for
their good and for the sustaining of our primitive doctrines and testimonies;
feeling sometimes not altogether unlike the Psalmist,
when he "`desired of the Lord to show him a token for good,
that his enemies might see it and be ashamed.`"

We were desirous of showing them that we would be glad to meet with them,
and hear their objections, if any they had, against us or our proceedings;
and they were in divers instances notified to this effect;
but still they were kept as much as possible from us,
yet the knowledge of our willingness to meet with them on friendly ground,
we believed would have some effect on them and their neighbors,
when they had more time to reflect upon it.
Our aim was to have meetings in neighborhoods convenient for most Friends to attend,
if disposed to do so.
Our first meeting was in the town-hall at Waterville, a large place on the Kennebec;
and when agreed upon, and whilst our notices were printing,
we went seven miles to Fairfield, to see Zaccheus Borman,
an honest old minister of eighty-four, but under the current of an influence against us,
and easily trammelled by reason of his credulity and stationary abode.

He seemed rather shut up at first, but pretty soon became open and familiar, and said,
in conversing a little upon my case, that justice was due to all men;
and we left him enjoying pretty good feelings.
On our return to Waterville, we met with Charles Coffin,
a prominent preacher of the same neighborhood, with whom we had much conversation,
in the presence of several respectable men;
but he seemed unable to maintain any one point in their case, and was much confounded.
A man present afterwards expressed astonishment at their
efforts to keep the knowledge of the case from their people.
Charles, however, said he would come to our meeting the next day,
and bring a book that would prove their cause to be good, and we encouraged his coming;
but he came not.
However, our being at Fairfield, and giving notice of our meeting,
brought down the postmaster and his wife, from Charles`'s own neighborhood;
she being somewhat connected with Friends.

After meeting they came to us,
and informed that they had seen in their office the "`Considerations,`"
and had read it a little before it was called for.
They were now very desirous of possessing a copy, which was soon sent them.
At the close of this meeting at Waterville, many inquiries were made,
touching our case--two lawyers and many other people of note being present.
Our next meeting was at North Vassalborough,
in the neighborhood of John 500. Lang and two brothers-in-law,
where our notices were set up in their factory village.
These notices were taken down--by whom it is not known--and
the people were told that our meeting had fallen through;
but as many as we had accommodations for came, and a truly interesting meeting we had,
greatly to my satisfaction, and I believe to all present; after which,
to satisfy the desires of the people, our case was briefly unfolded,
and many applications were made for books,--more than we could supply.

Here we saw the want of the "`Considerations,`" and the Answer
to "`Calumny Refuted;`" the latter have now gone that way.
Our next meeting was at the house of our friends, D. and A. Howland,
their mother and children, the only firm Friends in that quarter;
although a few others whom we visited told us that they had no unity with the Gurneyites,
but not yet strong enough to make a stand against them.
This last was also a favored meeting,
and I believe very strengthening to those dear Friends; to which, beside other people,
came two young Gurneyites.
Our next appointment was at Augusta, in a basement story;
but a great funeral assemblage in the room above us, held at the same hour,
unknown to the man who made the appointment for us,
occasioned so much interruption that no meeting for worship was held;
but a number of respectable people gathered to us for the purpose of information,
among whom was a member of the Society, of about sixty, a very moderate, solid man,
who said he had never had any information but on one side;
asked many questions of deep import,
and seemed no less surprised than gratified with the answers;
but the claims of others so interrupted him there, that he went with us to the inn,
and had much conversation with us that night, and came in again next morning.

I gave him three copies of my book,
and as many of the "`Address of R. I. Quarterly Meeting,`" to distribute and read himself,
of which he was glad.
Another sensible, elderly man here took great interest in our case,
and said he had been convinced of our principles,
but by reason of the bad examples and evident declension
of Friends thereaway from their first principles,
had been deterred from becoming a member.
He was also very glad of a book.
He understands our principles very well,
and will see by the contrast that Gurney is no Quaker.
After this we had two meetings within Falmouth Quarter, both good, solid meetings,
but no Gurneyites came.
However, we felt quite a freedom, and desiring also to show our good-will to all,
we called on many Gurneyite families, so called because they claim them,
but some of them without a cause,--they are merely held in bondage.

Among these we saw some joyful countenances on seeing us, and we were glad to see them,
for whose deliverance my travail and concern is intense.
But there were a few instances, and but few, that we met with,
where any bitterness was apparent;
nevertheless there are many among the ministers and elders,
and among the more elderly sort of the people,
whose hearts are sadly leavened with the same spirit that
leavened the hearts of the chief priests and Pharisees,
which is hypocrisy, joined with malice; and but for these,
many innocent ones might be made to see the things which belong to their peace,
although now they seem to be hid from their eyes,
by reason of these dark bodies standing between them
and the life of Him who is the light of men.

Oh! the condemnation that awaits these who have so vilely
cast away the shield which the Lord had given them,
and are found darkening counsel among the Lord`'s people.
Unless they speedily repent of their deeds,
in turning the innocent away from the fold of the true Shepherd, he will expose them,
and reject them forever!
May they be favored to find a place of true repentance ere it be too late!
Thus, in brotherly freedom, have I ventured, my dear friend,
to give thee a little of the outlines of my late arduous journey, which,
though not extensive, was yet trying;
and although sometimes I took condemnation to myself,
in an apprehension that better I might have done,
yet through infinite mercy and unmerited goodness when the service was accomplished,
we came on our way rejoicing;
not on account of the prosperity of the cause in that eastern country,
but because our little service was rewarded with sweet peace.

I ought to have told thee, in its proper course,
something about the Quarterly Meeting at Berwick,
but I understand that our dear friends from thence stopped a day in Philadelphia,
who would probably tell you that their Quarterly Meeting got along nearly as last year,
and that it was believed that we lost no ground this year.
After leaving Berwick, I attended two meetings at Elliot, before going further east.
To these went with me William and Elizabeth Hill,
and on my journey further east I had the company and kind assistance of my beloved friend,
Jonathan Nichols, of Salem.

I will just say that among the trying services to which I believed I was called,
was the visiting of two backsliders, one at Windham, and the other at Danvers.
Of the latter I have little or no hope,
but still feel satisfied and even glad that I went; if she must needs go away,
even into perdition, the Truth I believe will be clear.
Some of my views on the state of things in your land, and further west,
I wrote to my dear friend, Ezra Comfort, a few days ago,
as also what concerns us more than what Friends do abroad, or omit doing,
in relation to us.
Oh! if all of our little number could but be induced
to seek counsel at the door of the tabernacle,
on the bended knees of truly contrited souls,
we should have no occasion for fearfulness about
who would acknowledge fellowship with us abroad;
for then we should have better help than man, or of a body of men.
My wife and I are in usual health, and join in love to thee and wife.

My Dear Friend John Wilbur,

In looking round the length and breadth of our Society, both in your land and ours,
I can at present see little else than mourning and weeping in store
for those who are sincerely desirous that faithfulness to our religious
principles and testimonies should be abode in;
saying in the heartfelt language of supplication, "`Spare thy people, oh!
Lord, and give not thy heritage to reproach!`"
Still the Lord`'s ear is not grown heavy that it cannot hear.
And he is the same almighty and merciful Saviour as ever he was;
otherwise some might droop into despair.

I was at our last Yearly Meeting with my friend Caleb Haworth and one or two besides.
I endeavored to raise my voice on several occasions
in favor of the smaller body in New England.
Our efforts were neutralized in as civil a way as the leaders knew
how without manifesting the appearance of unfairness which we well
know cannot be openly tolerated in England as it is in America.
Our efforts were seemingly crushed under the quiet pressure of ponderous influence;
but we have some reason to hope one here and another there has secretly
imbibed impressions which may remain and deepen in his mind.
It proved a very trying season to some of us,
not because John Wilbur was involved in the question,
not because a small knot of suffering, persecuted,
faithful Friends were implicated and cast down,
but because it vitally concerned the great and all-important question
of our religious principles and testimonies for the Truth`'s sake,
by which multitudes of souls might be affected.
The "`larger body`" of New England Friends (so called)
has its powerful advocacy in this country at present,
and I suppose for purposes we cannot scrutinize,
must be permitted to rule and reign to a certain extent for a season.
But that such can ultimately stand I have no expectation.

Believe me as ever thy sincerely affectionate friend,

[.salutation]
My Dear And Valued Friend,

What wilt thou say to me for my long silence?
Truly thou hast not been out of my mind, or my heart, though so long neglected,
especially since my return from my northern journey at the end of 9th month.
I have seemed often with thee mentally; and the end of the 10th month,
I received thy last very kind and acceptable letter,
which renewed the feeling of dear love, and unity, and sympathy toward thee.
Ah! dear friend, I unite with thee in thy sense of the many eyes that are upon you,
and in the desire for your preservation in the true faith, and in a holy walk with God,
manifested by maintaining a true Christian warfare against
all unrighteousness and the spirit of the world,
as is expressed in thy letter.

And I tenderly sympathize with thee, and all the living among you,
under your many burdens and trials, by those who seem to be of you,
but who evidently have not gone through that deep
baptism which brings into the true unity,
and consequently into an union of lively exercise together,
for the upholding of the pure testimony of Truth.
May you, dear burden-bearers, be sustained under these trials,
as well as strengthened to spare no tender and faithful dealing for their help,
and bringing into a true feeling and laboring with you; and if you cannot,
by patient exercise and fervent prayer, be instrumental to their help,
then may you be enabled, in the love, and authority, and melting power of Truth,
faithfully to testify against them, for the saving of other members, and, if possible,
for the reaching of the witness in those to their ultimate recovery,
at some time or other!

Thus will you be clear, and the Holy One will be glorified.
I was very much interested in thy account of your travels,
and of the serious inquirers you met with, and hope your labors have been blessed,
to the enlightening and reaching of many, although they have been sadly reported of here,
as "`stirring up strife,
and promoting unsavory meetings for discussion,`" so that I have, in some instances,
thought well to give a little of thy own account where I could suitably,
that such vile reports might be frustrated;
for I conceive you were doing what our early Friends would have done towards
testifying faithfully for the Truth and against error and evil.
I think that one Friend (who has been your way) spoke very disparagingly of thy companion,
and also of thee.
But, dear friend, the burden will be heavy upon such false, reporters,
in a day that is coming!
May you be preserved low in the divine fear, then fear not what is said.

I hear the funeral +++[+++of J. J. Gurney]
was very showy and large,
and that the bishop of Norwich preached a funeral sermon at the cathedral;
does not this show that they were hand in hand and one in spirit,
and that there could not have been that faithful testimony against priestcraft
which all the true professors and possessors of the Truth must ever bear?
His death has caused a sort of shock; but he has left many children, in one sense,
who will carry on his views in shifting us from Quakerism to Episcopalianism!
So that there is no other expectation for the poor tribulated
remnant of those who cleave to the ancient principles,
but of continued and increased suffering;
and oh! that they may be preserved firm on the blessed Rock of Ages,
and united one unto another in him, and then, however they may be proved,
and have to suffer with, and for him, they will be sustained through all,
and eventually reign with him, and partake of his glorious victory overall.

And now, my dear friend,
I would inform thee of what I hear dear Rachel Richman has given thee a hint of already,
namely, that I have had it for several years on my mind, to remove to Aberdeen,
in the land of my forefathers!
I have gone through much in relation to such an important step,
as thou would`'st suppose, all nature would rise up to oppose it,
the leaving of all that are near and dear to me,
whether in a natural or spiritual connection,
and the going into such a northern climate for my delicate health,
and where there are not the comforts and conveniences that I have been accustomed to,
besides also the low state of things there, and many trials and very few fellow-feelers,
all combine to discourage the step!

I was not without the thought that perhaps my going there last summer,
and tarrying there a month, and laboring as enabled,
might prove a substitute for so trying a sacrifice;
but no! the matter was so cleared and confirmed while there,
and even the very outward difficulties smoothed down, in some degree,
that I found I must yield all up; and now I stand resigned to go, with my little all,
the end of the fourth month or early in the fifth month next,
feeling at present excused from the Yearly Meeting.
I would gratefully acknowledge that goodness and
mercy were with me during my late exercising journey,
sustaining, helping and preserving me from day to day, which is, indeed,
ever to be had in humble remembrance by me, and I desire that,
in the renewed sense thereof, I may be enabled to thank God,
and afresh to take courage to humbly hope for more,
even more still of his goodness and mercy to support and prepare me for the further
duties and trials that may await me in this vale of tears and scene of probation!

And, dear friend, do thou crave for me,
that I may be strengthened to fulfill whatever may be in store for me in my new abode;
whether in doing or suffering;
and that witnessing preservation from every snare of the insidious enemy,
I may be fitted, in due time, for the heavenly kingdom, by the grace of God,
in and through Christ Jesus.
I feel greatly for you, in being cut off from the visits of the faithful, at present,
but hope you will have patience till your cause is pleaded,
and your righteousness brought forth as the morning and your judgment as the noonday.

With the salutation of dear love, I remain thy nearly united and sympathizing friend,

Lydia A. Barclay.

From Christopher Healy to J. W.

Bucks County, Pennsylvania, 2nd of 6th mo., 1847.

My Very Dear And Much Beloved Friend, John Wilbur,

I received thy salutation of unfeigned love, a little while after our Yearly Meeting.
It miscarried and got to Doylestown, and lay there a long time,
but when I did receive it I was comforted, and rejoiced in spirit.
May thou, my dear brother in the Truth, be comforted, and filled with joyful hope,
for greater is He that is in thee, than he that is in the world;
this thou hast clearly proved, by thy great suffering,
for thy divine Master`'s and the church`'s sake.
May he be pleased to make bare his holy arm of power, for thy health,
both in spirituals and temporals.
I have often thought of thy dear bosom friend, how she must be tried as well as thee,
in that long and sore warfare.
May our blessed Helper be very near to strengthen you to bear up, now in your old age.
I have divers times read thy "`Narrative`" as well as some other accounts,
and I thought nothing short of Divine power could have carried thee so remarkably through.
Thou hast heard by this time, I suppose, that our Yearly Meeting this year,
condemned the unsound writings of Joseph John Gurney, and also of Edward Ash,
and the document after our next Meeting for Sufferings, will be published.

I was taken sick last 8th month, and have not yet recovered,
so as to be able to write but very poorly; my nervous system being so affected.
This is the first writing since my sickness, but my health is middling good otherwise,
and that of my family.
Oh! my dear brother, this is a sifting time to the members of our Society.
I have believed our poor Society will yet be sifted as wheat is sifted in a sieve,
for it is declared, "`I will overturn, overturn, overturn, saith the Lord,
until he shall come whose right it is to rule and reign.`"
Our Israel is too much mixed among the people of the world.
The language of my soul is, come out from among them, and be ye separate,
and touch not the unclean thing, and I will save you.

Now my dear brother in the gospel of the dear Son of God,
be not discouraged at these trying times,
for Zion cannot come forth out of the wilderness of this world, clear as the sun,
fair as the moon, and terrible as an army with banners, leaning also on her Beloved,
until she shall arise and shake herself from the dust of the earth,
and put on her beautiful garments,
then she will arise with Him who is the Resurrection and the Life,
and because he is the bread of life, our souls shall live also.
Oh! that this blessed day might come to the church,
then will judges be restored as at the first, and counsellors as at the beginning.
I do believe this time will come, though a great falling away may take place first;
but my dear friend, a people,
a favored remnant will be preserved of the true principle and name of Quakers.

I know when I consider all the circumstances connected with the case,
that thou mayest sometimes in thy poor soul say, Israel has almost forsaken the Lord,
but my dear friend, remember the answer of the Lord was to him in the still small voice,
I have reserved seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal, nor kissed his image.
I believe thou hast said many times under thy deep troubles,
as Jacob of old said concerning his dear son Joseph, "`Joseph is a fruitful bough,
even a fruitful bough by a well, whose branches run over the wall;
the archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him;
but his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong,
by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; from thence is the shepherd,
the stone of Israel.`"

These things thou hast largely experienced,
and they will be sanctified to thee for thy salvation,
and if thou shouldst not see the desires of thy soul in this world,
if thou keepest the word of his patience, through this tribulated scene,
thou wilt witness being kept in the hour of temptation, and, by and by,
when thou art gathered among the just of all generations,
to shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of our heavenly Father,
then wilt thou receive thy blessed reward, and thy joy will be full,
and no man will take thy crown, because thou hast labored and not fainted.

So now, my dear brother, farewell,
in the love of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ My dear wife sends her love to thee,
and thy dear wife and family.
James and Jane Moon also send their love to thee, and so would many more,
did they know of this freedom.
In the great satisfaction and love which for many years we have had together,
and for each other, the remembrance of which now rejoices my heart, I take my leave,
and remain thy affectionate friend,

My Dear And Much Esteemed Friend, John Wilbur,

I received thy truly acceptable letter shortly after date.
In reading thy travail and exercise for the prosperity of the church
I did sympathize and unite in fellow-feeling with thee,
not doubting that thy divine Master put thee forth, and went before,
in that arduous service thou gave me some account of in thy last letter.
However trying such services may be, and bitter the cups we may have to drink of,
yet as we are faithful to the divine requiring,
there is a sure and heavenly reward granted unto us,
that the enemies of Truth know nothing of, neither can they deprive us of it.
It does appear to me, and increasingly so of latter time,
that there can be nothing said or done that will stop or check the torrent of apostasy,
until we are closely sifted out of the mass of corruption
that is in our once favored Society.

I am ready to conclude that it is permitted, if not ordered, that good may come of it.
In the state we are in, how could we be as a city, or as a light set on a hill,
while there is so much darkness and corruption.
Oh, it appears to me the Lord has taken the work into his own hands,
that he will separate the chaff from the wheat,
and the chaff he will drive as with the wind from the summer threshing-floor.
It appears to me that this dispensation through which we are passing,
will be more trying than any which our Society has passed through.
I am ready to say, may it have its perfect work,
that the precious may become thoroughly separated from the vile;
and the remnant that will be left of the sanctified and redeemed,
who will have passed through many and deep tribulations,
and kept as in the hollow of the Lord`'s hand,
will they not be in his own time (which is the best time) raised up as on the
top of the mountains and exalted above the hills of all empty professions,
that the visited souls may once more look upon our Zion,
without seeing cause of stumbling, and may thereby be induced to flock unto it?

Some of us sympathize deeply with you;
the living members everywhere feel the need of all the comfort they can get.
I feel as if I am unable to write much.
My love and affection remains unchanged towards you,
and I hope it stands in that which can never be broken.
Please remember me to thy dear wife and all your children, as if named.
Thou art a brother and fellow-sufferer I trust, for the testimony of Jesus,
and art abundantly in my remembrance.
Please encourage our friends with you,
to keep and possess their souls in the everlasting patience of the saints;
tell them the Lord`'s work is going on, and will be carried on to his own glory,
and to the everlasting peace of his faithful children.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

The present and future condition and standing of our religious Society generally,
will be acknowledged by all who are well-wishers to the cause of primitive Quakerism,
to be a subject of the deepest consideration and highest concernment
to all who are making profession of the blessed Truth.
My mind has been of late peculiarly attracted towards
my dear friends on your side of the water;
accompanied with the like feelings which drew me
to your shores more than sixteen years ago.
This gospel love in the covenant of life and peace,
extending especially towards all who are sincere in seeking for a blessed inheritance,
has not been diminished by a personal knowledge,
and acquaintance with so many in that land; among whom there are not a few, brought near,
in the longing desires with which I am sometimes favored
in the aboundings of the Lord`'s mercies.

Nor has the lapse of time which has since passed away and brought
me so much nearer to the termination of all things here,
and a hoped for inheritance in a better world,
had any tendency to lessen in my heart the love of God,
or fervent desire for the happiness and well-being
of all my fellow-professors in your land.
In this view of things, my mind has of late been unexpectedly turned towards thee,
with an intimation that it would be right to introduce a little conversation with thee
in relation to the state of things and their probable result touching the continuation
and preservation of our Society at large in the same faith as at the beginning.

And it would seem that I could hardly have any occasion to say to thee,
that the subject of sustaining a correct faith in our doctrine,
is so serious in its nature and tendency,
as to involve the great question which relates to
the saving or losing of our immortal souls;
and imperiously calls for the avoiding of all equivocation and evasion,
and the adoption of a sincere and ingenuous confession
of all that we do believe and are intending to maintain,
in any way relating to the salvation of man,
by and through the coming of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
and the ministration of his gospel,
as it relates to all that he has done for man without him, and all that he has done,
and is doing for him,
within him,--principles fairly and fully included in the summary of Friends`' doctrine.

And it sufficeth me, on this head,
satisfactorily to ascertain that a member of the Society unequivocally believes in them,
and makes no secret reserve.
But if he profess the faith of Friends, and at the same time,
is either secretly or openly allowing or supporting
views that are repugnant to our doctrine,
or is upholding the authors of them; he cannot be rightfully acknowledged a true Quaker,
not yet a sincere follower of Christ.
Far better would be my opinion of one who comes out openly and ingenuously, and says,
he thinks there are errors in Friends`' confession of faith,
and stands ready to point them out, and defend his own.

I am persuaded, my dear friend,
that thy understanding of doctrinal subjects is clear and discriminating, and as I trust,
thou art so conscientious, that none could induce thee to yield to the opinion,
that the modern views published in England,
are in conformity with Friends`' doctrine as relates to the Holy Scriptures,
or their comparative standing with the Holy Spirit,
or with Friends`' doctrine of the light of Christ in man,
or induce thee to subscribe to those modern views on justification,
imputed righteousness, etc., to or many others which might be named.
But if in any of these particulars I am mistaken, and thy opinion should be,
that Friends`' original doctrines are susceptible of modification or improvement,
it is my desire that thou would candidly inform me wherein.
For I have full confidence in thy frankness and willingness to do so,
if such be thy opinion.

We, of the smaller, though original Yearly Meeting in New England,
(if the sustaining of the original doctrines entitles us to the appellation,) have not
as yet seen it right for us to add a single item to the original doctrines of the Society;
nor yet to take so much from them, or to propose any change in them whatever.
But my dear friend, if thou hast found, or if Friends in England as a body have found,
in the opening of the light of Truth,
that some change will contribute to the good of the Society, and to the honor of God,
or to the promotion of righteousness in the earth, we stand open to be informed of it.
And it is due to the whole Society to know in what
and in how much your view of a change consisteth;
whether it be to adopt the doctrines of J. J. Gurney
as they now are in the hands of Friends generally,
(as by some presumed to be intended because none of them have been officially
censured or condemned,) or whether to make other change.

Thou wilt not, I hope think these interrogatories intrusive or frivolous,
seeing as we learn,
that London Yearly Meeting has received and approved a highly
commendatory memorial of the author of those doctrines.
And seeing too that it is a subject of the most serious importance, what change, if any,
or what system of doctrines London Yearly Meeting shall establish,
not only on account of its own members but on account of the influence
which it will have upon Friends of other Yearly Meetings.
Surely Friends in England should not adopt a new system of doctrine
or give any ground for fear on that account by declining to examine
the modern doctrines and to contrast them with the ancient,
without advising their American brethren of their intentions;
a matter of the utmost consequence, as the aspect of things now is in both countries.

It has been reported that great unity was witnessed in London Yearly Meeting,
but in those of Philadelphia and Ohio, great dissension, howbeit,
some are disposed to ask if the same proposition for the examination of the new
doctrines had been made and enforced in the former as in the two latter,
would the unity of the former have been undisturbed?
But the value of unity is supposed to consist of the right
of those things in which a body of people are united,
and a dissension to be measured by the same rule.
Howbeit, it appears that things which cause disunity in one body do not in another.
And I would ask thee how can London,
or any other Yearly Meeting continue their fellowship by
a mutual correspondence with the larger body in New England,
when it is publicly known that the latter has sanctioned the violation
of moral principles as well as those of the Society,
abused and perverted its own discipline and the order of Friends
in a manner so fully demonstrated to the Society at large.

[.signed-section-context-open]
Spital, Aberdeen, 11th mo., 1847.

Is there not an uncommon backwardness and shrinking on the
part of Pennsylvania Friends from coming to the point,
which of the two Yearly Meetings in New England to recognize?
why did they not come to this point last Yearly Meeting,
for I understood the matter was the previous year deferred till then with orders that
the Meeting for Sufferings should in the mean time possess themselves of such facts
and data as should assist the Yearly Meeting in coming to a right decision.
I have put this question closely to my friend who is just
returned from America but he avoids answering it!
I fear he too is smoothing over with the plaster of love or of lukewarmness!

In my last letter from dear Mary Anne Bayes she says in reference to thy letter,
"`Ah! how cordial and touching was his true and tender sympathy to us who have
to take a few steps in the tribulated path which dear J. W. has largely trodden
and in which he has been strengthened to stand nobly for the testimony of Truth.
When thou writest please to convey a message of dear love to him from us,
and tell him we desire to be borne livingly in his remembrance for good,
as he often is in mine, and I hope the day may come when I shall write to him myself.
I believe he feels and knows that if I have not yet done so,
it is not because love has grown cold,
not yet because we shrink from owning him and the
good cause for which he is counted worthy to suffer.`"

Oh! the many snares,
the sight and sense thereof makes one tremble for one`'s self--but
the Lord`'s power is all sufficient to guide strengthen and preserve,
and oh! that I may be helped to keep thereto to the end!
I am here in an out-of-the-way corner,
and hear not so much of what is going on amongst us,
so I can`'t tell thee how the "`Appeal`" was received by the Meeting for Sufferings;
still, I trust I am not beyond the feeling and burden of things,
and mourning is the covering of my mind,
and I see no way of escape for the tribulated remnant,
except that I know there is nothing impossible with God!

The deplorable inconsistency amongst us as a people is very sad,
the complete lowering of the standard of Truth,
and often by such as ought to be high bearers of it,
so that in some places it seems in vain for the faithful ones to lift up their voice,
the overbearing flood is so mighty;
and to weep in secret and pour forth their cries to Him who is omnipotent and omniscient,
is all they can do!
There is a sad wicked system of persecution of such as hold,
and especially such as uphold publicly, the ancient principles at Leeds in Yorkshire,
but as fast, nearly, as they silence one, another is raised up by the Divine power!
The same overbearing spirit reigns elsewhere and its plausible influence
is most sad though not as yet carrying things to the same height.

My Dear Friend John Wilbur.

I am but little able to reply to thy kind, sympathizing letter as it deserves;
but I am willing to attempt to send thee a few lines,
that I may not appear entirely insensible to thy
affectionate regard displayed towards a poor,
sorrowful widow, feeble alike in body and mind.
My dear husband`'s health had declined much these two years past,
his strength was impaired by excessive bleeding from the nose,
which was thought to relieve his head, the state of which had given us cause of alarm;
added to this in winter he was subject to bronchitis, which became chronic,
and he was but little free from cough and laborious breathing;
but he went about though much enfeebled in body, looking pretty well in the face;
taking the Sulphur Water at Harrowgate often relieved him.
He gradually declined from his accustomed activity;
but was always able to attend our various meetings, and diligent in helping therein.

The first day but one before he left us, he seemed quite as well as usual;
we were both twice at meeting,
but next morning he was poorly and kept his bed with what seemed a common cold;
in three days seemed better, then relapsed,
and grew ever worse from that time notwithstanding all that skill, care,
and love could do to keep him, for we were very sorry to part with him.
His chief suffering arose from difficulty of breathing which nothing could alleviate,
and in ten days he passed from us, in great peace and resignation,
perfectly clear to the last minute.
I was very ill of the same complaint, but strengthened to be with him at the last,
that last that I feared to think upon, that I thought it impossible I could bear to see,
I was helped through.
I seemed in spirit to be with him, on the brink of Jordan,
and felt nothing but comfort and peacefulness in seeing him pass quietly away,
our three sons and daughter tenderly nursed him by night and by day; to them, to me,
and to many relations who came to see him, he addressed pertinent counsel.

No, my dear friend,
he never had at any time any doubts or misgivings as to the primitive doctrines of Friends,
nor assimilated in any degree to those of a contrary tendency,
and whenever we conversed together on those subjects to the very last,
it was with the continued conviction that the sentiments
of our early Friends were of the Truth,
reaching the witness in our own minds, and confirmed by Scripture,
and we never regretted for a moment having, however feebly,
endeavored to uphold the ancient testimonies and doctrines taught by Fox, Barclay, Penn,
and other confessors of the Truth, nor of having published thy letters,
which first let in a ray of light, upon what was acting and working underneath;
and that and thy company and labors preserved us and ours from being carried away from
the Truth for which I am and shall always be truly thankful--not that we merited it,
but of the Lord`'s goodness and mercy he preserved
us from being shipwrecked on the rocks,
or lost in what might be likened to a specious quagmire,
full of fine dazzling appearances.

I am still of the mind that in this land originated
all the persecution that has followed thee,
and that it is yet fostered in the same region.
In our parlor at Mount Vernon threats were used to thee,
which I dare say thou hast forgotten but I remember well,
often pondering on those things, when I see the scattered,
poor state of many who left us, expecting to exalt themselves unto a church of renown.
Many are gone very low back into the world, some settled into a dry form,
all much under priestcraft, one way or another.
My dear G. and I have passed through many pinching things connected
with these changes and troubles--met with much contempt and unkindness,
even from some who seemed like bosom friends; we have encountered open reproach,
and worse, the double tongue, but we freely forgave all;
we never were free to open much of this to thee knowing
how great thy own burdens of this kind were,
and wished not to add to them.

My Dear And Valued Friend,

I am much obliged for thy explanation of how matters are at Philadelphia;
it is exactly as I all along suspected! it is these conservative
ones who do so much harm both there and hereaway.
I would rather they came plumply out and showed their
real side which is that of the new views in truth,
though they think to put on an appearance of love to the ancient ones,
and can therewith make a fair show in the flesh,
which deceives even some whom one would think might see through them!
My dear friend, thou asks me to tell thee who are sound Friends here; there are so few,
who are out and out, ancient in their feelings and faithful thereto,
that a child alas! may number them.
The majority have modern views, or else these middle ones, as I have described;
and the generality are indifferent, caring for none of these things,
so they can have plenty of agreeable preaching.

My dear friend, I unite with thee,
you have no need to be over careful in regard to
being acknowledged by other Yearly Meetings;
the main thing is to seek to be preserved firm, on the alone sure and right Foundation,
in humility and faithfulness,
watching to keep your garments so that ye may not be found naked--and
then you will not fail to overcome evil with good,
and "`he that overcometh shall inherit all things,
and I will be his God and he shall be my son`"--and this
truly is more than all the acknowledgments of men!
So I desire you may not faint nor yet grow slack, but be steadfast in the divine counsel,
immovable in the divine fear! always abounding in the work of the Lord;
forasmuch as ye know your labor shall never be in vain in the Lord,
but established in his peace and blessing.
Farewell, my dearly beloved friend,
my dear love salutes thee and thine and all faithful
Friends in your land in the Truth that is unchangeable;

My Dear Friend,

Neither thy husband`'s solicitations for an interview,
nor yet the manner in which he reprobated the course which I had taken,
has given me any personal dislike, either towards him or towards thee;
but I can address either of you with the same freedom as ever; however,
I do lament the course which you appear to have been pursuing--so different
from that which led me to warn the Society against the degenerating doctrines
which have been largely spread abroad among us.
An obligation on my part in conformity with the injunction of our valuable discipline,
and in accordance with a sense of duty; and like the framers thereof, I saw,
or thought I saw,
great danger consequent upon the promulgation of such views among our members.
The discipline enjoins upon all our Quarterly and Monthly Meetings,
as well as upon all faithful Friends, to warn all our members against the spreading,
and consequently against the imbibing of unsound doctrines;
for which the reason is obvious--the same which had always induced
honest Friends to endeavor to discourage and to put a stop to the
circulation of unsound doctrines in the Society,
and why?
Because they were dangerous to the safe standing of our members,
and of the Society at large.

But it seems that many of the larger Yearly Meetings do not so regard the discipline,
and are of a different opinion from the Yearly Meeting which issued it,
as well as from all our worthies,
both ancient and modern--so careful and zealous in detecting
and in giving a warning voice against all unsound doctrine,
tending to draw away our members from their allegiance to Friends`' principles.
If Josiah Jones`'s sentiments, when my letter, to which he alludes,
was received in your neighborhood, were the same as they are now,
in relation to such a question,
there is no marvel that the letter was "`unsavory`" to him.
Like the early Friends,
it was my conscientious concern that all sentiments
which were contrary to the faith of Friends,
should be testified against.
But if it was Josiah`'s opinion that no one should say aught against such unsound sentiments,
then I do not wonder at all that my letter to Eli
and Sybil Jones was "`unsavory`" to him.

But how does he relish Paul`'s testimony against advancing unsound doctrines,
where he says,
"`But though we or an angel from heaven preach any other
gospel unto you than that we have already received,
let him be accursed.`"
Did he not hereby enjoin upon the Galatians to condemn
all those who advocated adverse doctrines,
let them come from whence they may?
Whether a Paul or a Barnabas from other countries, or even an angel from heaven?
And did not the same apostle show that the difference of the savor
consisted in the difference of the condition of those addressed,
when he said that himself and those who were with him,
were the savor of life unto life to some, and the savor of death unto death to others?

And I do most sincerely desire that my friend Josiah
may remain no longer in such a condition,
as that an honest testimony against anti-quaker views
will give him pain or be unsavory to him;
nor yet in such a state of mind, as that Paul`'s declaration to the Galatians,
twice emphatically repeated, see chap.
1st, ver. 8 and 9, will be in any wise unpleasant to him;
nor yet the care and faithful measures taken by Philadelphia and Ohio Yearly Meetings,
in doing as I have done,
in testifying against the false doctrines which an enemy has caused to be poured forth,
for the purpose of destroying the Lord`'s beautiful, ancient heritage, so dear to him,
purchased with the blood of his son, our Lord, and with the blood of saints!
And how lamentable, indeed,
that the enemy should have beguiled any of the once
innocent lambs of the fold and flock of Christ,
to consent to join hands with those who have enlisted in this work of
grievous and general delusion in principle among the Lord`'s people!

Oh! my dear friend, my heart yearns for thy preservation,
and my hands are lifted up to the God and Father of all our sure mercies,
beseeching him that he would rescue thee and all
the innocent ones from the paw of the devourer,
by drawing you nearer and nearer unto himself,
by gathering you out of the strife of tongues, unto his own holy,
quiet and peaceful habitation, where the canopy of his love,
goodness and power will be your protection and sure defence.
Here, if it might be, through adorable mercy, thy happy lot to dwell,
even the fiery darts of the enemy shall fall to the ground as at thy feet,
and do thee no harm, and no creature shall be permitted to make thee afraid.
Oh, then, my dear fellow-pilgrim for time, and fellow-heir for eternity,
and for that joy which is unspeakable and full of glory:
I beseech thee let no man take away thy crown,
and suffer neither men nor angels to make thee believe that Truth is a delusion;
or that the way up to God`'s holy kingdom has been made
wider than that in which our crucified Lord walked,
and in which he required his disciples to follow him.

The will of the flesh would have a wider path, and less rugged,
but when our wills become sanctified, and by his baptizing power,
are moulded into a perfect conformity to his will, then this narrow way,
in which our Lord himself and his disciples walked, becomes to us an easy,
safe and pleasant path;
because in it we have the sweet and joyful company
and guidance of Him whose glory filleth all things,
and whose wisdom in fitting our way to our condition, is wonderful,
and whose condescending mercy and goodness in manifesting
his will unto those who wait patiently on him,
is admirable indeed.
And his favors in guiding their steps aright,
calls for our deepest thankfulness and humble prostration before him;
as well as a desire for walking in his holy fear, and in great watchfulness,
lest through the false radiance of the fallen angel we should miss our way.

But how can any expect to be favored with the living spring and life of the gospel
ministry who give their strength to those who are laying waste this blessed faith
of the inward and immediate revelation of God`'s will to men,
by upholding and defending those who have resorted to so many turnings and windings
in order to weaken and dissipate our faith in this very doctrine--I say how can
such expect to preach the gospel by the revelation of Jesus Christ,
or in the demonstration of the Spirit and with power!
How vain is the repetition of many words in our assemblies,
(however good in themselves those words,) without the renewed anointing!
If any profess to preach by the Spirit whilst they
are upholding those who are preaching without it,
such are dishonoring it, by exalting the letter above it.
This is exceedingly reprehensible,
because such are laying waste by their conduct that
which they profess by words to be building up!

Thy namesake, that eminent and faithful handmaiden of the Lord, (in England,) Ann Jones,
adhered firmly to our ancient principles to the last,
and died in sweet peace with the Lord.
She continued to write to me frequently as long as she remained in mutability,
endeavoring to encourage and strengthen, not me only, but all the honest-hearted.
Her desires and prayers were unceasingly lifted up to the
Lord that he would spare at least a remnant of his people,
and give not his whole heritage to reproach.
And so also the prayers of many servants of the Lord continue to be lifted
up to Him whose ear is always open to hear the cries of his children;
and if they remain faithful to him, and to his testimonies,
he will cause them to grow and to flourish as the
green bay-tree that standeth beside the waters,
which bringeth forth fruit in its season, and which will, I trust,
as there is an abiding in his covenant,
be to the praise of his ever great and excellent name.

But on the other hand,
however great the number among the tribes of Israel who depart from his statutes,
and from his testimonies, if they will not hearken,
but continue to despise or lightly esteem his covenant
and prefer their own ways to his ways,
and shut their eyes to the visions of light, as at this day,
he will scatter them among the nations of the earth, and they shall be as other people.
The name of the Lord is a strong tower--a mighty Rock,
whereunto the righteous flee and find safety;
and those who gather to it and put their trust in him, whether they be few or many,
he hath promised that he will in no wise cast off.
He can increase the few and exalt the humble,
and it is his delight to do so if they will love and serve him.
He can scatter and diminish the proud and those who are lifted up,
as well as the great multitude, who are trusting in their numbers,
as he hath often done heretofore, as testified of in the Scriptures.

But one thing is sure and unfailing.
He will have regard to those who serve him faithfully, and love him unreservedly,
and who fear him and tremble at his word!
What will avail the attempt of some of the Yearly Meetings to bring about
a reconciliation or union of the whole body as they call it?
In what are they to be united?
In the views of J. J. Gurney?
or in the ancient Friends`' doctrines?
If it be in the one it cannot be in the other;
for it is impossible to reconcile Gurneyism with
ancient Quakerism--if these are amalgamated together,
it will be but a heterogeneous mass of absurdities.
Let each of those Yearly Meetings which propose a coalition,
first cleanse their own camp at home by faithfully purging out the leaven of unsoundness.
Let them closely examine the new doctrines, and be willing,
honestly and scrupulously to condemn and renounce all which
are not in accordance with our ancient principles.
And when all unsound doctrines,
all unwholesome and wrong practices are condemned
and removed from the different Yearly Meetings,
and all such persons also as will not forsake the same,
then what need of deputations to meet together for uniting on Christian ground?
When these impediments are removed the purpose will be accomplished.

Gurney`'s doctrines have produced the disunity in the Society,
and no way can be devised to restore a union in the Truth,
short of a condemnation of those doctrines.
All attempts to conceal and hide them under a veil of the finest spun texture,
or under the fairest possible profession of, or pretension to Quakerism,
can never restore the body to health and soundness until
Gurneyism is publicly condemned throughout the Society.
The greater the number who are united in wrong opinions, the worse,
because the evil is so much the more formidable.
It is stated that no less than one hundred and sixteen millions
of people are united in the idolatry and other atrocities of Popery,
under the cloak of Christianity,
and that there are one hundred millions of the Mohammedan religion.
Gurneyism approximates towards Episcopalianism, and Episcopalianism towards Romanism.
Happy and dignified was the advancement in coming out from Romanism up to Quakerism;
but lamentable indeed are the process and the consequences of returning again thitherward.

We have sufficient testimony to prove that the larger body have
implicated themselves in the apostate doctrines of Gurney,
for the more candid acknowledge themselves to be in unity with him,
while those who are less so, will not answer the question;
but in refusing they commit themselves to his views, as entirely as the others,
and equally so do they in refusing to say whether Gurney`'s
doctrines are in conformity with those of our early Friends.
These evidences go to confirm in the strongest manner those which we have
heretofore published to demonstrate that the larger body generally have
fully identified themselves with the views of J. J. G.,
and therefore are not Friends;
and their attempts to hide their condition from the well informed, are vain and futile.

Well then, my dear Ann, to evince to thee, as above stated, that Gurney`'s views are,
in many fundamental points, palpably at variance with those of our Society,
I would refer thee to the divers contrasts which
have been made by plain extracts from Gurney,
placing them side by side with those from early Friends,
so that any person who can read and understand our language, and more especially,
if he be blessed with the perceptions of Truth, can but see the difference;
and the evident perversion of our sentiments by J. J. G.
I would refer thee to those taken by William Hodgson,
Jr., by our Quarterly and Yearly Meeting, by Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, with comments,
and lastly by thy correspondent, in his appendix to the "`Narrative and Exposition.`"
And although it may be, as Gurney`'s books have gone through many editions,
in different type, that the passages quoted may not compare in all his works alike,
yet the extracts, by diligent search, will be found correct,
and the sentiments will be found to be his verbatim.
Gurney`'s defence entitled, Calumny Refuted,
does not charge any one with incorrect quotations.

Finally to conclude,
I would refer thee to the authority of Robert Barclay to
decide the question as to which party are the separatists;
he says, "`that those who depart from the doctrine are the separatists.`"

And all impartial and candid people, without the Society, are clear in determining,
as by common sense it is determined,
that those who uphold and defend the author of the new doctrines,
are the separatists and have become another people.
One editor of a religious periodical says,
that Gurney`'s doctrines and the doctrines of Friends
are as different as are Arminianism and Calvinism,
a judgment from which no impartial reader of both will dissent.

However unsavory this letter may be to Josiah,
it is but due to him to have the reading of it; for it is unto him as well as to thyself.
I would also, that my dear friends Eli and Sybil Jones may see it; and,
be assured my dear Ann, that any remarks if written in good feeling, in reply to it,
by any of you, will be kindly received, and carefully read by me.

My Dear And Well-Beloved Friend,

Although I am indebted to thee for a good letter written from Scotland,
yet I had fondly anticipated, that after the Yearly Meeting in London,
thou would inform me by letter, how things transpired there; yet,
not having the satisfaction of receiving, either from thee or any other hand,
any account of the Yearly Meeting of women Friends,
I felt that I must wait no longer for a letter, but endeavor,
however incompetent I feel for it,
to answer thy very interesting and obliging epistle of 3rd mo.,
11th. Some parts of the account of the men`'s Yearly Meeting,
as stated in the "`British Friend,`" is indeed very interesting.
That some were undaunted in upholding the Truth, and exposing the error of its opponents,
and so honest in saying where the error originated, was truly cheering to Friends here;
and evinces that a shaking time is to come upon those strong ones,
who have dared to set their hearts,
if not lift up their hands against the Lord`'s own precious testimonies,
so dear to him and his faithful ones--to those who
know him and love him with their whole hearts.

Oh! the cup of trembling must and will be, sooner or later,
given to these perverters of Truth, to drink,
if there is not a returning speedily unto Him whom they
have rejected--unless deep repentance is witnessed;
for, alas,
the day will come when they cannot turn their eyes
from looking on him whom they have pierced!
Then will they not call for the mountains to fall on them,
and the rocks to cover them from his sight,
if they shall not have repented before that dreadful day come?
O, I long, if it be a possible thing,
that these may bow in mercy to the Lord`'s righteous judgments,
before the day of retribution shall have passed over their tabernacle!

When men get wrong, and their vision is darkened, how inconsistent they will be;
however powerful they had been in the understanding and wisdom of men,
they will err in vision, they will stumble in judgment!
How vain and short sighted for those in London Yearly Meeting,
at whose door lies the blame of disunity in the American
churches,--because they would not,
when in their power, suppress the unsound doctrines which produced those dissensions,
but encouraged the sending of them to America,--I say,
how inconsistent to propose lending their assistance by an epistle,
for the reconciliation of the American Friends,
whilst on their own shoulders the blame resteth,
for the going abroad of the unsound doctrines which are the sole
cause of the disunity now existing in the American Yearly Meetings,
and they manifestly continue to uphold those doctrines.
Might they not as well have said at once,
let this Yearly Meeting advise the American Yearly Meetings to be reconciled
to all the doctrines which have been written by J. J. Gurney and Edward Ash,
because we allow their circulation without hinderance or molestation,
and they are to be embodied with the doctrines of Friends.
Alas! what a heterogeneous mass of incongruities!

Now look, my dear friend, at the minute this year recorded on the Yearly Meeting books,
"`as a united body upholding our ancient standard of faith and practice,
in all its fulness, spirituality and simplicity,
we desire to dwell under the weight of this concern,`" whilst not far distant,
as I suppose, on the same book,
stands recorded the fullest approbation of J. J. G. and E. Fry,
whose doctrinal writings and practices are cherished
by the leading members of London Yearly Meeting!
How palpably opposed to every idea of candor, integrity and consistency!
How can men become so lost to the understanding of our language,
and the perceptions of Truth on their minds, as to be prepared for such attempts;
even to mingle together truth and error, light and darkness?

For as well might they, as to attempt mingling together in one,
the doctrines of Friends and those of Gurney.
Or is it rather their intention,
that as the latter are more agreeable to the natural mind,
they should spread and overshadow the former,
as it is to be feared they have already done in many places?
Oh! what dreadful havoc they have made and are making with the Lord`'s people.
If they should succeed as far as their desire would evidently lead them,
what an immensity of condemnation must await them;
and it would be a marvel if a fearful looking for of judgment
does not already greatly trouble their lonely moments.
When together, by receiving honor one of another,
they can seem to make it do somewhat tolerably;
but when they feel that God only is present with them,
how can they endure their own condition, and how soon attempt to fly?

How different is the work of turning many from righteousness,
from that of turning many unto righteousness.
Oh I can but compassionate their condition and crave that
the Lord would forgive and interfere with his mighty power,
and deliver them from the impending ruin.
And how thankful it becomes us to be,
that we have not been left to make shipwreck of the living faith in the gospel power!
O, we should not consider it to be because we are better than they,
but of his wonderful and abounding mercy!
And my dear sister, how it behooveth us to walk in fear,
and in much trembling before him lest we also fall;
for it must be through the humblest intercession and wrestling with God,
that we can be spared from the hidden snares of the destroyer!

Oh! then we will unite in prostrating ourselves before the God of our fathers,
that he would deign of his mercy to keep us as he kept them,
and prosper the feeble work of our hands, only by and through his holy help,
in assisting to keep alive a remnant of his children,
by whom his great and excellent name may be honored,
and that the nations may be made to know that there
is a God who walketh and judgeth in the earth.

Thou wilt probably see an account of our Yearly Meeting in the "`British Friend.`"
And it is a consolation to find that our number has not diminished,
nor their faith failed.
And however small that number, we feel to have no cause to lament our condition,
but rather to rejoice that we are of one heart and one mind
in the faith of the ancient doctrines of Friends.
And my desire and prayer is that we may not only keep the faith of the early Friends,
but be favored to live such lives as they lived.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

Persuaded as I am that the principles of Friends are grounded on primitive Christianity,
leading more directly and more entirely than those of any other people,
when practically observed,
to the accomplishment of the one great object premised by the gospel of our Lord,
I have long considered that a faithful support and maintenance of them by a holy
life and conversation,--thereby clearly demonstrating by living experience their
efficacy and the truth of what we profess,--is a matter of the greatest importance
of anything which devolves upon those under our name in the present day.
Indeed, as our profession, reduced to practice, through the power of Truth,
is preeminently productive of consummate righteousness,
its success and prevalence is of greater consequence in
the world than anything beside that can be named.

Hence how needful it was and how needful it remains to be,
that this people called Quakers,
who were through the power of an endless life redeemed from iniquity,
placed and established upon that safe foundation
(other than which no man can lay) should have abode,
and should continue to abide on this foundation, which is Christ Jesus the Rock of Ages.
It is only by and through the power of Truth that this can be witnessed,
to the raising up and keeping alive of the image of God in the souls of men,
evincing to such that the church must stand on the
Rock and must be manifested to be so standing,
by her fruits, confirming thereby the doctrine that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh,
and in the hearts of the true believers, ruling and reigning there.

Now whilst the church, through watchfulness and vigilance abides here,
all keeping a single eye to Christ the Light,
witnessing the indispensable blessing of being baptized
by the one Spirit into the one body,
so long will peace and harmony, faith and good fruits abound.
But if unhappily the church shall,
through unwatchfulness and the stratagems of the enemy, slide from this foundation,
alas! how soon will the oneness and the unity be lost,
because she has broken that spiritual bond of union which alone it was
that kept her within the sound enclosure and upon the sure ground.
Consequently she becomes broken to pieces and scattered abroad and is exposed to dissension,
and to whatever wind of doctrine--under whatever
name through the artifice of men--the enemy may suggest.
Whilst she thus remains estranged and off the foundation, and scattered,
who can reconcile her to God, and her wandering tribes or sons one to another?
There is no device of man or of the sons of men that can bring about a spiritual union,
a Christian fellowship, or a heavenly reconciliation,
whilst the church and her children are in an apostate condition,
or until they can be brought back from their slidden
condition to that Rock on which she was built!

If men had power to tame and subdue the fallen angel whose name is Legion,
and who would feign possess the swine, rather than have no abidance on the earth,
then let it be supposed that men can reconcile in one all those
who are seeking to rest the sole of their foot on other foundation,
including, not only apostate Quakers under the name Hicksites and Gurneyites,
but (as well) all unsound professors under every name!
When the primitive church was sliding, and had slidden from the true foundation,
then dissensions arose by means of false doctrines brought in,
leading to corrupt practices.
Whereupon, in order to prevent division,
an arm of flesh was resorted to by her faulty leaders,
first by ecclesiastical authority in order to coerce all her members to
a conformity with the corrupt sentiments sacrilegiously brought in;
but this kind of authority failing to effect the desired purpose, they sought for,
and in the event possessed themselves of the full
exercise and control of the secular power,
whereby they were enabled to force men to a kind of unity,
and conformity to their will and pleasure,
and by the most arbitrary means they did for a long time,
and in a great degree bind the body fast to their decrees,
and mostly prevented the annoyance of open dissensions.

But had there been strength enough in the primitive church,
and that strength seasonably and faithfully exercised in
averting this departure in the beginning by individual dealing,
in the authority of Truth, with all those who brought in false doctrine,
and had the judgment of Truth been placed upon them,
then the church might have been spared from her apostate and lost condition.
But, alas! what was the worth of that unity or outward conformity,
which was through the most subtle contrivance forced upon the nominal Christian church?
Nothing at all, nay a thousand times worse than nothing;
because the greater the number that are brought to join in wrong things,
the greater the evil and the more injurious and lamentable the consequences.
But this is the way that the church in its lapsed condition from the Truth,
has ever been found to be at work,
exercising every possible means within its reach to gather the multitude to itself,
and to reconcile them to its own ways.

Seeing in "`The Friend`" thine and thy brother Paul`'s
names among others appointed by New York Yearly Meeting,
as a deputation to meet other similar bodies at Baltimore,
for the professed purpose of "`restoring the Society to the unity and fellowship,
that formerly characterized it,`" I felt that I wanted to ask thee, (supposing thou knew,
being one of the committee,) by what means,
and into what condition the Society were intended to be restored?
Whether into a oneness of faith as well as into outward unity.
There could be nothing, I believe, that would give me greater joy than to see,
whilst I am here, all who are professing to be Friends,
brought into a fit condition by the power of Truth for a
union in the covenant and fellowship of the gospel of Christ.
I know of but one outward medium through which it can be effected.

Nevertheless, if such can be in any degree the Lord knoweth.
However,
the step you have taken would seem to induce one
to suppose that you have measures in view,
and at least a little faith to believe that those
measures would succeed in effecting the object.
It is most probable that a large majority (however grievous to
all honest Friends) of those professing orthodox Quakerism,
are satisfied with, or what is equivalent to the same thing,
have no testimony to bear against the doctrines of J. J. Gurney,
and that the bulk of New York Yearly Meeting is included
therein--circumstances which naturally lead to the question,
is it your desire or intention to bring all others either openly
or covertly to a reconciliation with these doctrines?

Now the confidence which I have in thy candor induces me
to hope that thou wilt not withhold from Friends anywhere,
who inquire, your object or the premises contemplated.
But if your intention is otherwise, I would ask,
do you expect to testify specifically against the unsound doctrines of Gurney,
and fully to rid the Society at large from them;
so that it may again be restored to a unity and fellowship in its primitive doctrines?
Or different from either,
can any one be persuaded that you propose only to bring about a nominal unity,
without that unity being grounded on any specific doctrines and testimonies whatever,
and altogether regardless of the past, whether the doctrines of ancient Friends,
or those directly the reverse are held and believed in the Society?
If a "`unity and fellowship`" can be experienced by men, without regard to doctrines,
good or bad, then that unity and fellowship cannot be valid; but exists only in name,
and must needs include all the professors of religion of any sort!

Touching such a view as this, last mentioned, let us hear Robert Barclay.
He says, "`If the apostles of Christ of old,
and the preachers of the everlasting gospel in this day, had told all people,
however wrong they found them in their faith and principles:
Our charity and love is such we dare not judge you, nor separate from you,
but let us all live in love together,
and every one enjoy his own opinion and all will be well.
How (says he) should the nations have been?`"
Again he says: "`would not the devil love this doctrine well?`"
An easy question to answer.

Thou may find more sentiments appropriate to the point, from page 512 onward,
in the first volume of Barclay`'s works.
If love, unity and charity are to cover up and hide all pernicious doctrines,
why did the apostle testify so zealously against them,
and prohibit any fellowship with them and their authors?
or has the nature of such things changed since his time?
But evidence is not wanting to prove that the great mass of our people in New England
are taught to believe that there is no essential difference between Gurney`'s doctrines,
and the doctrines of Friends; and I apprehend that it is in this,
if not in many other Yearly Meetings, so promulgated by the Gurney party generally,
however extremely absurd it is;
consequently if a general delegation should ever go to the fullest extent,
in a literal avowal of our ancient doctrines,
but should make no clear and specific disavowal of
the exceptionable doctrines of J. J. G.,
all their efforts for a reconciliation must prove a curse instead of a
blessing because many unsuspecting people might thereby be misled,
and would undoubtedly be drawn into an apprehension that inasmuch as Gurney`'s
doctrines had been widely spread in the Society by its leaders,
and defended by the greater number of Friends, and now in no sort disapproved by name,
or prohibited by the grand committee from all the Yearly Meetings,
they would be considered by many to be sound and safe doctrines;
and so being most agreeable to the natural man,
may cause the utter apostasy of hundreds or of thousands.

Suppose the Hicksites should appoint deputations in the same way,
and ostensibly for the same purpose;
and when met should fully avow the ancient Friends`' doctrines,
but should studiously avoid condemning Elias Hicks`'s doctrines, how much I would ask,
would that do towards restoring all parties to the unity
and fellowship that formerly characterized the Society?
We know that they have always held out,
and professed that they believe entirely the doctrines of ancient Friends.
Nevertheless, they have, and they do at the present time,
seldom fail when occasion offers, to eulogize the memory of Elias Hicks,
just as the leaders do in most of the Yearly Meetings the name of Joseph John Gurney;
so the London Yearly Meeting this very year,
have placed on their records the profession "`of upholding our
ancient standard of faith and practice in all its fulness,
spirituality and simplicity,
and a desire to dwell under the weight of this concern,`" whilst
not far distant on the same book stand recorded high encomiums
on the religious character of J. J. Gurney and E. Fry;
whose heterodoxy they cannot, as yet, be induced to disclaim or condemn.

Were the ancient Friends addicted to such contradictory proceedings?
Those abiding in the Truth, I think were never caught in such absurdity.
Does New York Yearly Meeting think that an association or outward coalition,
(like some modern notionalists,) of all the Christian professions
and denominations without any change of their principles,
would be consistent in the Divine mind;
or that it would be an improvement in what is called Christendom?
Is not a contention with error and evil,
and a separation from it better than to be at peace with it?
The idea that people of adverse doctrines can safely
walk and associate together in religious fellowship,
conflicts entirely with that wisdom and Christian economy, which led George Fox,
and those of one heart and one mind with him,
to separate themselves from the confusion of tongues among the different professors,
and to become gathered into a Society by themselves.

If the different Yearly Meetings could be favored
to purge their own camps from unsound doctrines,
(which surely they might if they have not become apostate themselves,) they would
then become as that little but sound Yearly Meeting of Friends in New England,
is in heart and mind of one principle, fully embracing that of the early Friends,
clear from Hicksism and without Gurneyism, humbly hoping and desiring,
through the Lord`'s mercies, to be enabled to stand fast in Quakerism without alloy.
If all might be favored through infinite mercy to hold fast simply to this,
there would methinks be not much need of a Congress of deputies
to harmonize together the different Yearly Meetings,
for as one was so would all be.

Let all the Yearly Meetings, then, which have not already done so,
give forth a public testimony against unsound doctrines,
which have of late been the sole root and ground of disunity in the Society;
and then let the discipline be exercised in the proper department,
and in the wisdom and authority of Truth over those, if any there should be,
who will not conform to such a decision; then unity will be restored.
Now, my dear friend, to conclude, I would say, that as things now are in the Society,
I see no other way, nay, I think there can be no other,
for restoring the Society to the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace,
and to the only true fellowship,
but by purging out that which has been and yet is the root of dissension;
but if in thy apprehension,
and in thy brother`'s there is any other way or any other measures,
whereby such a dignified purpose can be effected, thou wilt be pleased, I hope,
in the like freedom in which I have written thee to state to me your views thereon,
and much oblige thy ever sincere friend,

[.salutation]
My Dear And Valued Friend,

I am only just returned home from the Yearly Meeting and visiting
my dear relatives and friends in the neighborhood of London,
and hasten to salute thee in renewed (yet ancient) love by this packet;
and shall be much pleased to receive a letter from thee,
and to know by it at what time thou received my last,
which I sent thee the middle of 3rd mo.,
in answer to thy affectionate solicitude about my health!
I was at that time about to visit the families in
two meetings of this small Monthly Meeting,
which through divine mercy and help, I was enabled to do, to my great relief,
and was favored with the flowings of peace very unworthily;
my way seemed opened and my mouth too, after having been shut up for near a year,
almost entirely; and though very weak in body, I was graciously sustained.

The epistle from Philadelphia has been usually read on the first opening of the meeting,
before entering on the queries, and with much solemn quiet and impression of manner,
but last year and this year it was thrust last of all, and into an afternoon sitting,
(as it were in disrespect.) It was a beautiful epistle,
and excellently adapted to our true state; but it touched too closely for some to bear,
on the difference between the true and the false love and unity,
and how the enemy can transform himself into the
appearance of an angel of love as well as of light.
Therefore our troubles, (that is, our apparent ones,
for much quiet had prevailed before,) commenced when the
committee sat on the subject of answering this epistle,
which was the firth day of the first week, for as soon as it was read,
divers Friends declared it had been dictated by the wisdom of the evil one,
and written in a wrong spirit, and had the savor of death,
and therefore it should not be answered!
Whilst a few of the faithful,
suffering remnant expressed their feeling that it had the savor of life,
and desired a sub-committee might be named to answer it.

Those who had the sway were the strongest and most determined in their expressions,
and it was concluded not to answer it.
At the next sitting of the committee on epistles, (7th day,) dear Hannah Marsh,
of Croydon,
was made so innocently bold as to bring forward again
the subject of the Philadelphia epistle,
she not having been present before, and one or two others seconded her,
desiring that at least that Yearly Meeting should be treated with
due respect in naming a subcommittee to feel upon this subject.
This proposition by some strange revolution in the minds of a few influential ones,
(some politic considerations I suppose,) was acceded to by some of those
very persons who had two days before so strenuously resisted it;
but it was to be on condition that the sub-committee
should be mostly of such as held their views,
and if the epistle were answered, it should be very short and in a certain line!
What limiting of the Spirit was here!

However, some of us were glad under any circumstances to get a sub-committee,
and what was afterwards produced was much more tolerable than some of us had feared,
though of course not the language that would have flowed
in our minds towards our dear Friends of that Yearly Meeting!
We also had a very trying discussion relative to the expression
"`suffering with the suffering seed,`" in the address to the counties,
a pouring forth of unsound views from the modern Friends on the subject,
which they in all their carnal wisdom could not possibly fathom!
This was the second week.
Our select sittings were exceedingly trying as usual, and only three in all,
one being omitted,
thus crowding all the burden and exercise that ought
to come upon that meeting into a short space of time;
to the wounding, as I believe,
of many! but man`'s wisdom and policy plans all for these meetings,
and his will and power act in them,
and can we wonder at the most of trial and suffering being in those
meetings when we remember and feel that it is true concerning us
that "`the leaders of this people cause them to err?`"

But we need not be greatly moved at anything,
for if things are by trials brought nearer to a head (as it were) amongst us,
there will be more hope of deliverance; so we must trust all in the good Hand,
who can overrule all for good to them that love him,
and support them through all he permits to try them.
Philadelphia Yearly Meeting has deferred to another year
the considering of your case and recognizing you!
I expect the modern Friends there will take advantage of this time which they have gained,
(as I imagined by weakness of others!) to ply all their
efforts to overturn the measure of recognizing you.
I expect also that many there are looking at the probable consequences,
for if they recognize you they must testify against us,
and others who are in unity with the larger body.

The feeling in the London meetings is very trying, but thou wilt, I fear,
say I am always mourning! there is indeed a cause,
and George Fox and our other faithful worthies of old times would have to cry
"`woe to us,`" the same as they did to the other professors of their day,
for they would not know us to be their people! still there is a little, faithful remnant,
and they lie low and scattered, by ones and twos about in different parts,
and when many of these meet at Yearly Meeting time
they can understand each other`'s speech,
being of the heavenly country in truth, and not merely in show,
and they feel knit together, and strengthened together in God,
and they take a little fresh courage, and thank, and praise His holy name,
who has hitherto helped them, and desire still to trust in him,
for what he will yet do for and in them!
And you, dear friends, are not forgotten by them at such times;
and other faithful and tribulated ones in your land;
for true heavenly love flows over sea and land,
and nothing obstructs it--not death itself! for He who fills with it,
gives the victory over death, hell and the grave, blessed be his holy name forever!

Farewell, my endeared friend, in a measure I humbly trust of this true love,
desiring thy breathing when favored with ability, and I remain thy nearly united,
and affectionate friend,

From J. W. to Ralph And Lydia Neild.

[.signed-section-context-open]
Hopkinton, 9 mo., 5, 1848.

However long our correspondence has been suspended, my dear friends,
I have not been altogether unmindful of you;
although many trials and deep baptisms have fallen to my lot,
and perils to the church of our Lord have intervened, I have not forgotten you; nay,
but of late, and more especially within a few days past,
my mind has been almost continually with you,
and my best feelings of love and brotherly affection have been drawn freely towards you,
with uplifted heart and hands for your, as for my own preservation,
that notwithstanding the shaking and trial of our foundation,
I have desired that we might, in the Lord`'s adorable mercy,
be spared from the ruin which threatens this people,
that so when the faithful and redeemed of the Lord are enabled to come
into his presence in heaven with joy and gladness upon their countenances,
we, my dear friends, may be of the joyful number.

The endearing cord, my precious Lydia, which first bound our hearts together,
remains the same in mine at this moment as when rejoicing
with thee under thy paternal roof;
or as when at all times in which I was privileged sweetly to enjoy
thy company in those precious seasons of our personal acquaintance,
drinking together of the one Spirit, when the Lord, in his everlasting kindness,
united our hearts in the bonds of his blessed gospel of life and power,
which I desire may never be broken.
And oh! that this desire may be mutually cherished between us to
the full consummation of the pure love of God in our hearts,
and that to the end of our pilgrimage here in time;
for certainly if we are favored to continue loyal
to our espoused covenant with the bridegroom of souls,
and to his testimonies over and above all other obligations, whether to men or angels,
then my dear friends,
this bond of a Christian fellowship with the meek followers of a crucified Lord,
will neither be marred nor broken; for whether it be through evil report or good report,
they must, and will be one another`'s joy in the Lord.

How entirely, then,
our peace and preservation depends upon our keeping a single eye to him and to his testimonies
and commandments in the "`obedience of faith`" as have the faithful in all ages;
in which our honest predecessors were conspicuous,
being living examples and holy walkers,
fully believing in and maintaining the doctrines
of primitive Christianity in the life and power thereof;
knowing by living experience that primitive Christianity could be witnessed, practised,
and experienced in their day, and, consequently, to the end of time,
as it was at the first, through the light, life,
and power revealed by Jesus Christ our Lord in the souls of men.
The misgivings which an enemy has introduced into our Society
of later time touching our faith in the inward light,
life, and power of Christ the Lord,
has done incalculable mischief both in your country and ours.
It has undoubtedly caused hundreds of our ministers to let
go their hold of the faith of immediate revelation,
whereby there has been,
(sorrowful to say,) a lamentable falling back from the spirit to the letter;
holding to the form, but practically denying the life and power!

This degeneracy has been seen and known not only by the living among us,
but by other people also;
and it seems very strange how those ministers who have heretofore been
favored to preach in demonstration of the Spirit and with power,
can now be satisfied only to preach themselves, or to preach the letter.
Oh, how can they be contented no more to hear the voice of the true Shepherd,
and only to follow the voice of the stranger, or to hew out cisterns for themselves.
Their condition and the condition of the church under such sad declension,
is greatly to be lamented.
Instead of that peace and joy which proceedeth alone
from the smiling countenance of the blessed Shepherd,
and the honor which cometh from him only,
their portion can be no more nor better than the honor that is
received one of another,--bread that will never sustain the soul.

If the peace of God be withheld from us, what will avail the praise of men?
What would avail the commendation of all men?
What would it avail to our souls to enjoy the love
of men or angels if shut out from the love of God?
Oh, what a consolation and stay in our tossed condition it is
to believe and to know that God is the same yesterday,
today, and forever,
and that he is as willing to reveal himself and his will in man
as ever he was,--as willing as he was when the Lord Jesus exhorted
his ministers to wait for the promise of the Father which,
(says he,) ye have heard of me.
He had before told them that when they were brought before
kings and rulers to bear testimony to his name,
not to premeditate beforehand what they should say,
"`for the Spirit of my Father shall teach you in that same hour what ye ought to say,
for it is not ye that speak but the Holy Ghost that speaketh in you;
and I will give you a mouth and a wisdom which your adversaries
shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.`"

This doctrine he had before preached unto them,
and now again at his last personal interview with
them on sending them forth to teach all nations,
he exhorted them to wait for the same qualification;
and to strengthen their faith in this blessed helper, to wit, his own spiritual presence,
he said, "`Lo I am with you alway, even to the end of the world.`"
And there is not a single reason which can be rightfully rendered why this should
not be the experience of his ministers in this our day as at the first.
Nay, verily, and blessed be the name of the Lord,
there is a remnant yet spared abiding in the same faith,
and through the mercies of God to the church and to their own souls,
do witness the fulfillment of this blessed promise,
as they trust to his goodness and power and are obedient in waiting for it;
to this I can place my seal by both former and continued experience,
and in which I feel bound, under the strongest obligation,
to give the glory unto the Lord God and the Lamb to whom it belongeth, world without end.

And how strongly are we bound, my endeared friends,
to praise the name of Israel`'s Shepherd,
that he does yet vouchsafe immediately to reveal his mind and will to his humble,
obedient children,
that do believe and trust in him and in the revelation of his life and power.
Notwithstanding the excellency and great favor to us of the Holy Scriptures,
through the opening of the Holy Spirit, yet without this,
and without any intercourse between God and his church
immediately revealed how forlorn would be her condition;
even as with the world at large, scattered as it were by the confusion of tongues;
diverse in their interpretations of the most essential doctrines of Holy Writ,
for the want of faith in the continuance of divine revelation.

I am persuaded, my dear friends,
that the doctrines of our first Friends which are very dear to me, are also dear to you;
and if so I hope nothing will deter you from a faithful adherence to them;
that neither principalities nor powers, things present nor things to come,
nor any other creature will ever be able to separate you
from them nor from the love of God in Christ Jesus,
upon which and in which those doctrines are undoubtedly grounded and contained.
I do, my dear friends,
feel a living desire and concern that there may be kept and preserved a people both
in this and in your land faithful to the primitive doctrines and testimonies of Friends,
and prepared to withstand the plausible seductions of the unwearied adversary
who is seeking through the wisdom of the wise of this world,
insidiously to lay waste the true heritage of God as he has been
striving to do in the different ages of the world.

It appears by a recurrence to the history of the past that whenever the Almighty by
his Providence and by the arm of his power has effected a reformation of mankind,
that the enemy of all good has not failed to bestir himself in order again
to pollute those testimonies whereby that reformation had been accomplished.
We might refer to the means resorted to for the perversion of the Lord`'s work by Moses,
for a reformation from idolatry,
as well as for the perversion of the great apostolic reformation, and now again,
(to pass over many others,) for the perversion of
that notable reformation by George Fox and his associates;
which attempts, as we have seen,
introduced the most beguiling transformations both on the right hand and on the left.

But well will it be for those whose eyes the Lord of Sabaoth hath anointed to see the
deceitfulness of the means brought into requisition for effecting the enemy`'s purposes
in deterring this people from the consummation of that holy work which their predecessors
had so faithfully and honorably begun and advanced,--I say happy,
for these if they unflinchingly abide the baptisms essential to the work of their day,
and keep the word of God`'s patience through all,
then he will bless the work in their hands,
and cause the church again to come up from the wilderness
leaning on the breast of her Beloved,
and enabling her to break forth both on the right hand and on the left.
Then through faith do we not see that her cords will be lengthened and her stakes strengthened,
and many shall run to and fro and the knowledge of the Lord be increased,
and judgment shall run down as waters, and righteousness as a river.

My Dear And Valued Friend,

Oh, how helpful and strengthening (and what a blessing!)
is spiritual unity with dear fellow travellers,
as we pass along this weary way! it is next in comfort
and enjoyment to the supreme fellowship;
yea, it emanates therefrom, is a precious fruit thereof,
and as thou sayest is consummated in the realms of heavenly, everlasting,
and unshaded bliss.
I was grieved to hear of the weakness of poor John Warren,
though I had hardly any knowledge of him, having missed him when in this country,
except at one meeting.
Ah! it is very depressing in these last twenty-five years to see and feel
the changes in those whom we have heretofore esteemed highly;
and latterly they have been very rapid,
even the last few months shows the warping aside of one or another!
Surely if there were not a little remnant preserved alive
we should be like unto Sodom and Gomorrah.

I shall feel much interested in hearing of your Yearly Meeting,
which I suppose is about this time; where you had it, and how attended,
and if favored with heavenly good, as I hope it may have been.
I was reminded of what dear Sarah Grubb said to me in 1834 in reference to E. Bates:
"`Lydia, didst thou ever see so exact an imitation of the precious gem?`"
Ah, the enemy has his imitations and images whereby to
draw us away from the pure unchangeable Truth;
when one is detected, then he decks up another;
and the more like the life the better for his purpose,
if possible to deceive the very elect!

There is latterly got up amongst us a preaching apparently of ancient doctrines,
a using of ancient expressions, and an extolling of our ancient Friends,
which last could not be endured by some of these same Friends eighteen years ago!
But even the very babes who cleave to the Divine gift of light and life,
and the savor thereof, can taste and feel the deficiency underneath all this!
The poor Irish Friends were so beguiled by these things,
and the winning love and sweetness that overpowered all,
that they were induced to send for the first time
an epistle to the larger body in New England;
and also to acknowledge the acceptable services of S. H. (whose long,
and painful supplications, etc.,
had tried some of us greatly!) and to give her a returning certificate.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend Elizabeth Pitfield,

I have felt my mind for these few days drawn into near brotherly feeling with thee,
and I think I may venture to say,
in the sweet springing up of a little portion of that love,
which through infinite mercy is permitted at seasons to water and to refresh
the whole heritage of the faithful servants and handmaidens of the Lord;
and in this I salute thee as a dear sister;
and truly the time seems long since I have been favored
to see thee and dear +++_______+++ face to face,
a privilege which I long to enjoy, at least once more in mutability;
and there are many others both in city and country with you,
whom I should rejoice to meet with again on this side of the confines of time,
(to me so near at hand,) if consistent with the will of our heavenly Father.

But every desire, however good,
must centre in the will of Him who holds in reserve the immensity
of unsullied enjoyment for all those who abide in his fear,
and in his love, and serve him faithfully.
But oh! if it were not for the hope of such a reality,
in the society of those I dearly love, and for the still better hope,
of an unceasing participation in the love and goodness of Him whose loveliness
infinitely transcends even the loveliest work of his own hands,
my heart would despair in the fleeting uncertainties of time.
But we are bound to rejoice evermore and in all things to give thanks that he
has ordained for us the additional enjoyment of the sweet company of the kindred
spirits of those who are made near to us in time by reason of the deep baptizing,
and the drinking together of the one Spirit--all together,
how inexpressible the consummation of his mercy, his goodness, and his glory;
and how astonishing that any of his rational creatures should despise
the enjoyment of his favor and the riches of his kingdom.

May the goodness of the Lord, which pervades all his attributes,
await thee my dear sister,
and give unto thee an increase of all the requisite qualifications
for the fulfillment of thy mission to thy own peace and joy,
to the furtherance of Truth`'s cause among his people,
and to the honor and praise of his great and holy and ever worthy name,
in which I would include dear,
and all that precious number yet spared by reason of their
meekness and lowliness from the overwhelming surge of temptation,
be their allotment among his people what it may; in which desire my wife joins me.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend Mary Davis,

My wife has ever since we left Newport been gradually
gaining a little in health and strength,
for which favor I trust we are thankful to the Giver of every good and perfect gift;
and well may I say for the many bestowed upon us,
how greatly are we indebted! and I do exceedingly desire that we may,
during the few remaining days that may be allotted us,
give up more and more to greater devotedness to the good cause;
but at the same time take good care not to run too fast,
which we know would mar the work more than help it;
but we will be glad and rejoice in this, that there is a way of safety,
and of getting rightly forward in simply filling
up the measure of duty whether less or more.

Is it not by dwelling low in self-abasedness, and living near, very near,
and continually with Him who is a mighty fountain of wisdom and strength?
Surely without the pressing forward towards this mark for the prize
of the gospel minister`'s high calling in Christ Jesus,
that blessed gift of a living ministry will, and must be lost to the world.
But I desire and hope that there may be preserved through these sifting times,
at least a living remnant,
who will hold fast the profession of their calling without wavering,
to the honor of Him who has called,
and to the upholding of this blessed gift and experience,
of knowing him to put forth and go before his servants,
which is the very glory of the gospel dispensation,
unknown by the great bulk of Christian professors;
and none too well known and experienced by all under our name,
even in our little company that have been trying to stand fast.

Self, and the creature, if not sufficiently humbled and mortified,
puts in for a share in the work,
and is exceedingly prone to claim in itself a share of the honor of it.
This want of a thorough redemption from the will of the flesh has
been a great detriment to the Lord`'s prophets in all ages.
There is much reason to believe that many of the true prophets
in olden time became lost to the true gift,
and finally were found among the false prophets.
Indeed there are so many wayward influences acting even upon sincere minds,
that nothing less than the repeated baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire is found
sufficient to keep us entirely on the right stepping-stones.

I apprehend that the Society of Friends, from the first,
has never been for any length of time together, exempt from trouble of this kind;
it has not been so throughout our Yearly Meeting since my time; nevertheless,
we have always through the Lord`'s mercies been blessed
with a goodly number of living ministers among us;
and many times great favor we have known in a Yearly Meeting capacity, formerly,
even when everything was not entirely as would have been desirable;
and so I presume we might say of our late solemnity,
concerning which I think we have on the whole much to be thankful for, hoping, as I do,
that something has been gained; and I greatly desire that we may hold fast,
and be favored to grow stronger and stronger, so that on account of our faithfulness,
generations to come may have occasion to glorify our Father in heaven.

In much love to thyself, and all faithful Friends in your Quarterly Meeting, I conclude,
and am very affectionately thy friend,

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

Thy kind letter of 10th mo., 12th, was received on the 30th of the same,
an unusually quick passage; and was very acceptable and consolatory to me,
inasmuch as thy hopeful anticipations of,
and expressions on a purification of the precious from the vile amongst us,
a backsliding people, were truly cheering and animating!
For really, dear friend, some of us do feel that things are getting worse and worse,
more and more of the evil or backsliding becoming apparent continually,
and as a dear friend says in a letter to me yesterday,
"`What we have already gone through seems, as we fear,
only as the beginning of sorrows!`"

I notice what thou sayest as to the measures used to beguile the Irish Friends,
and I was not without somewhat of a similar feeling when there, at their Yearly Meeting,
and I regretted that some of whom one would have expected better
things were not more on their guard against these plausible devices!
The Philadelphia document I had just received when I got thy letter.
It is an excellent, clear thing, and I hope may open the eyes of many,
but there have been such very evil thoughts industriously propagated
against Philadelphia Yearly Meeting during the last three years,
(and which their dilatoriness in stepping has no
doubt contributed to spreading,) that with many,
I fear such a document will only be scouted.
Had Philadelphia acted with more firmness and promptitude early,
I expect it would have better helped both us and
other Yearly Meetings on your side the water.

[.salutation]
My Beloved Friend,

Although thy precious, consolatory salutation of 8th mo., 30th, 1849,
is as yet unacknowledged, I may tell thee I have thought of thee and thine,
and dipped with you, methinks into very low places, whilst the many weights, exercises,
and trials of my poor spirit have almost precluded efforts
to commune with any of those I love in this way.
Truly we live in a day wherein we may well take up the mournful lamentation of the prophet
respecting many of those who stood in the fore ranks even of the people,
"`thy silver is become dross,
thy wine mixed with water,`" and ofttimes under a sense of our own jeopardy,
and the state of the church, we are clothed in sackcloth,
and stationed as at Marah`'s waters, while in the depth of our humiliation and distress,
we are made willing to go to the King as Esther did with the petition,
"`Lord if I perish let it be at thy feet.`"
"`Spare thy people, O Lord`".

Ah, how many times does my heart visit your little meetings
wherein the great and good Shepherd and Husbandman does,
I doubt not, visit your souls, and feed you with the manna sent down from heaven,
and can but crave that He who alone can turn the hearts of men,
as a man turneth the watercourse in his field, will undertake for us, and hasten,
if it please him,
the time when we shall be able to pass from the one part of his heritage to the other,
among all those wherever situated who belong to his church militant on earth,
who are of one heart and of one way,
who desire to know nothing save the Lord Jesus and him crucified,
and are striving together, though separated by bonds,
for the "`blessed hope of the gospel.`"
These are they who can in this day testify as did the apostles of old,
of those things which they have seen with their eyes, which they have tasted,
and which their hands have handled, of the good word of life,
and having descended into suffering and death, with and for their dear Saviour,
can call upon others to come and have fellowship with them,
in that blessed fellowship which is with the Father and with the Son,
and one with another in him.

I doubt not, my beloved friend, some who have despised thee,
and counted thy life madness,
will be astonished at the evidence that thy Lord has numbered thee among his chosen,
and when he cometh to make up his jewels will set thee as a stone in his crown,
yea he will spare thee and many more, I trust, who have walked mournfully before him,
as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.
While the testimony of gainsayers will be as in olden time,
"`We fools counted his life madness and his end to be without honor,
how is he numbered with the children of God, and his lot is among the saints.`"

Let us then, my dear friend, press on, hoping all things and enduring all things,
if so be in the end we may reap the salvation of our souls.
May the arms of thy hands continually be made strong by the mighty God of Jacob,
(who took thee in early life,
and has led thee and given thee a part in the ministry of reconciliation,
and has blessed the work in thy hands,) until he grant thee from Pisgah`'s mount,
to view the length and breadth of all the land he has given thee,
and conduct thee in peace over Jordan.

My Dear Friend John Wilbur,

In the love of the gospel I write unto thee to inform thee that I received
thy very acceptable letter yesterday which we read with great satisfaction,
and were comforted in feeling thee so firm in the
ancient faith once delivered to the saints.
May He who has been thy bow, and covered thy head in the day of battle,
continue with thee and renew thy strength in him whose arm is everlasting strength.
I know of no one in these latter days of trouble in our Society
that has had so deep baptisms to pass through as thou hast.
But my dear friend,
may thy soul be filled with thanksgiving and living
praises to the great Captain of our salvation,
who was never foiled in the field nor overcome in the day of battle.

Nothing but his help could have sustained thee and
thy dear friends in such times of sore conflict;
and my heart`'s desire and prayer to the living God is that you may hold on your way,
for I do believe the victory will be obtained if your faith fail not.
Remember the blessed declaration that the mountains flowed down at his presence.
When this scourge has sifted our poor Society enough,
he will take the work into his own hands and show
who are his friends and who are his enemies,
as he has in some measure began to do already.

Oh, my dear friend, as thou art so thoroughly converted, strengthen thy brethren;
yea speak often to them and one unto another,
and the Lord who has been your helper will hearken,
and a book of remembrance will be written before him.
Thou with myself art of the number that have stood firm for that blessed
cause which is dignified with immortality and crowned with eternal life;
hold fast the beginning of thy confidence steadfast unto the end,
that so the crown may be sure.
The time is approaching when thou as well as myself must be offered up,
and may we through watchfulness and holy help,
be enabled to adopt the language of that faithful apostle Paul:
that we have fought a good fight, have kept the faith and finished our course,
and that henceforth there is a crown laid up for us,
which the Lord the righteous Judge shall give to us at that day,
and not to us only but to all those that love his appearing.

Oh, if our poor Society had loved his appearing there never
would have been such a leaving of the ancient stepping-stones.
But my beloved friend, let us not be too much discouraged;
our heavenly Shepherd can raise up sons and daughters from the highways and hedges,
bring them into the church and qualify them for his work and service.
My mind is enlarged, but my hand fails by reason of the weakness of my nervous system.
I have not written so much as a line since I wrote to thee, until now,
so thou will excuse my short letter.
I am middling well except my nervousness; my family are also well.
Give my love to thy dear wife and to all inquiring friends.

Please to write soon that I may know how thou feels concerning that better part,
as well as how thou art in bodily health.
So I conclude in that love which shall abide,
thy brother in the gospel of the dear Son of God,

Fifth day, after meeting, the 5th of 9th mo., 1850.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

Abounding has not been prevailingly my lot, since I parted with thee at Newport,
although now and then a fresh spring has been met with by the wayside,
of good refreshing and living water,
insomuch that it would seem for a short season that I should hardly thirst again,
but alas, how soon these joyful streams are passed by,
in pursuing the healthful Christian travel over the
ascending and descending pathway of life;
and I will not murmur, because the more painful the labor,
and the more intense the thirst, the greater the joy, when,
in everlasting and unmerited kindness, the fountain is again opened,
for the refreshment of the weary and needy soul.

The coming here once more of dear Christopher Healy was truly a brook, if not a river,
to us,
for on some occasions the stream rose so mightily that it was deep enough to swim in;
seasons, in which the gospel was preached in so lively and powerful a manner,
that none present were able, nay, nor disposed to gainsay or condemn,
although gospel justice was done to ceremonial religion,
and the life and power exalted above all forms.
It is believed among us,
that he is remarkably fitted for the promulgation and exaltation of our doctrines,
and at the same time to persuade Friends to live up to their principles.
And however unsatisfactory it was, that his certificates were not in common form,
or such as he and his company were entitled to have had,
it appears that his services were very satisfactory wherever he went;
and the conduct and conversation of himself,
dear Sarah and G. W. Brown were exemplary and of good report among us.
And we trust that a good reward awaits them,
as they are favored to give the glory to Him, who put them forth, went before,
and brought them back, as I trust, in peace;
although we have not heard from them since they arrived home.

Honest Friends in New England are made glad that
the standard-bearers in your land have not all fainted;
and are encouraged to hope that many there are yet remaining,
who prefer Jerusalem and her testimonies above their chiefest joy,
and unto whom the Lord our helper still giveth help
and understanding to uphold the blessed cause,
and a heart of willingness to be exercised therein, and in its service.
And I do rejoice, my dear fellow-laborer,
that a more undaunted spirit in the Lord`'s cause,
is more and more being developed in Philadelphia and thereaway,
and I am comforted in a hope that though the unflinching faithfulness of a few,
the victory of truth over error will eventually be gained,
to the honor of the Lord`'s great and ever worthy name!

I had been from home nearly two weeks, and in the time,
attended the Quarterly Meeting at Berwick, and divers meetings that way,
and came home enjoying serenity and peace of mind.
Oh! may the Lord, who is omnipotent, keep our little heritage close home unto himself,
and preserve them a living and united people, serving him with their whole heart,
and doing honor to the name of their great Deliverer!
I do not feel that I have got entirely through with this very serious
concern of having religious opportunities with other societies;
and however formidable and trying; the great openness among them,
and the peace and joy consequent upon devotion to this service,
have hitherto encouraged me to pursue it; believing, however,
that a release will ere long be proclaimed, and more rest enjoyed.
This service, however, has been, in mercy, leisurely meted out to me,
for this half year past.

I remain very affectionately, as ever, thine,
in the fellowship of that gospel which is surely unchangeable,

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

There is very much which we are obliged to bear patiently, which we have no unity with,
and see no way but to wait, till the way of relief and release more evidently appears,
and is made; hoping to be preserved from improperly putting forth our hands,
as well as from shrinking on the other hand when clearly required.
And now, oh what shall I say about poor Philadelphia Yearly Meeting!
Surely we must mourn and lament at their inaction!
Oh! the conservatives or middle men, do more harm than the more open opposers;
because acting under a plausible guise of patience, meekness and love,
and keeping the harmony!
I believe they will be made more manifest in due time,
and the faithful remnant must make a stand against them,
and testify boldly for the pure Truth!
I feel afraid of looking to any for help,
for "`in vain is salvation hoped for from the mountains!`"

Ah!
I sadly fear (though untold) that W. E. is one of the conservatives,
and has done much harm by his great influence as clerk to this Yearly Meeting.
I have long suspected it.
And how earnestly do I crave the preservation and help of
the faithful and upright remnant amongst them,
as well as you,
and that in due time liberation and recognition may strengthen your hands respectively!
And oh! for our little handful here,
may we be preserved in faith and patience to the end, which crowns all, and is peace!
I am through mercy recruiting in health, since my return home on the 11th of this month,
and favored with the flowings of that peace, which I value far more than gold,
desiring to be humbled in self-abasement, melted in thankfulness,
and animated to renewed devotion to the best of Masters in future!
Hoping this will find thee and thine favored with health,
I remain in dear love and near unity, thy true friend,

Perth, 10th mo., 26th, 1850.

[.salutation]
My Beloved Friend,

Thy last dated 8th mo., 10th, I received on the 28th of the same,
and it was very acceptable.
I had an account of your Yearly Meeting from W. Hodgson, who was there,
and it greatly interested and comforted me,
and a few other of my dear friends to whom I showed it in confidence.
Oh! what a comfort it would be to some burdened minds to meet together
thus in a purified state in our Yearly Meeting capacity.
But dear friend, there is great need for you to keep a close watch over your own spirits,
and to cleave to the pure gift of Divine light and life,
that so you may be preserved in a true living exercise,
in purity of doctrine and discipline,
in faithfulness of practice and in deep humility before the Lord;
for many eyes are upon you for evil, watching for your halting, your declining in life,
or exaltation above the lowly and safe ground!

I earnestly and unceasingly desire your preservation on every hand,
and especially that your little camp may be kept clean by a right and living discipline,
such as was first set up amongst us!
I wish that other members of different Yearly Meetings on your
continent might be also stirred up to go and see and feel for themselves
how things are amongst you--it might remove much prejudice.
It appeared by W. H.`'s letter as if those who went from
Philadelphia Yearly Meetings were mostly younger Friends;
it would be desirable for older ones and those of acknowledged weight to go,
whose judgment might be more valued.

I am distressed on account of W. E.,
having for some years felt a fear he was leaning to human wisdom and prudence,
to the hindering of the true zeal,
and consequently to the hurt of the pure cause of Truth!
His influence being so great in their Yearly Meeting,
I fear such conservative views will get strengthened
and increased to the weakening of many,
and to the burdening of the more upright and faithful!
We have had +++_______+++ and +++_______+++ amongst us this month,
they took up their quarters under my little roof at Aberdeen.
We had much conversation together,
and I touched on their Yearly Meeting`'s backwardness in acknowledging you after
they had united with the report of their committee and had waited and seen the
different treatment the two bodies in New England had given their document,
and therefore knew thereby what manner of spirit each was of! and
I endeavored to show how 1 felt upon those conservative views,
and what harm they might and I believed would do.

Ah!
I fear it is a device of the enemy to frustrate the
shaking off of impurity from our Society,
and the arising thereof, and shining forth in the glory,
and to the spreading of the kingdom of the Lord and his Christ!
But he is able to bring good to his chosen and faithful ones,
even out of all the evil that the wily enemy causes;
and I have thought that these things are an additional call on us to watch against our
own spirits and to seek for renewed humility and close keeping before the Lord,
that so these things may not drive us off our guard,
or out of the true patience and lively exercise,
but may tend like a very hot furnace to our further refining
and establishing in purity and real value.

I was pleased to see by the Philadelphia "`Friend`" that
Ohio has not yet yielded to recognize the larger body.
Every year we seem retrograding,
and though in some respects our last Yearly Meeting seemed more favorable,
it was somewhat comparable to a fire which before it bursts forth
seems to be almost gone! so that some of us seem to shudder in
the fearful looking for of what may come upon us ere long!
But we know nothing shall harm us if we be followers of that which is good,
and so we desire to possess our souls in patience,
humbly trusting that the Lord will cause all things to work
together for good to those who truly love him.

My Dear And Valued Friend John Wilbur,

I can fully enter into feeling with thee respecting your own state.
I can believe you must feel the want of the refreshment
and help of the spirits of divers visitors from a distance,
whose company you have formerly been used to have;
but I agree with thee it may perhaps be so wisely ordered for your preservation,
and if you have the life of the blessed Head of his church circulating daily amongst you,
what can you want more!
He can make up for the want of all outward helps!
This will keep you in a savory and consistent conduct and conversation,
in a pure and lively ministry, and in a faithful discipline,
which may keep your camp clean!

I often think it was the want of a faithful exercise of the discipline,
one hundred and thirty years ago,
that let wrong things in ministry and practice creep in amongst us,
and get rooted and spread a leavening influence over others,
whereby such universal gradual degeneracy overcame us!
And now to look at and consider well our Society,
it resembles more than ever the other sects and professions that are in the world,
except as being peculiar!
We are lamentably gone from that testimony against evil,
which originally we were called to uphold.
Our numbers are lessening,
and younger ones do not so quickly rise up to fill their places.
Whereas, those of the modern sort who are removed by death,
are very rapidly succeeded by others in their spirit.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

I can fully enter into thy account of the laxity
in practice and discipline in the larger body;
and I believe it will be more and more evident and conspicuous,
as it is becoming with us in England,
until we shall merge into the ways and spirit completely of the mass of other professors;
though perhaps the plain dress may be the last thing
that may be given up to fall to the ground,
inasmuch as it looks so plausible and sweet, and adds respect to us!
And I do not look for any relief to the oppressed remnant until this time shall come,
and then I believe a faithful remnant will be gathered,
out of the many lifeless professions (and ours among
them) as in the beginning of our day!

And then Truth shall mightily increase and shine brightly!
I long that you, and all those who hold truly to ancient principles in our land,
may be close in watchfulness unto prayer for our mutual
preservation in uprightness and in deep humility,
even if we should see the fall of many;
for we know it is the Lord`'s power alone that can preserve us from falling,
and his grace that shall be sufficient against all trials, and for every duty!
In thinking of our lapse, (as evinced by lifeless ministry, laxity of discipline,
immorality, swerving from true simplicity and sincerity,
inconsistency of practice as regards gravestones, manner of doing business,
and not disowning in divers instances for marrying contrary to rules,) and of
the shaking that there is in this country among the various professors,
separations among the dissenters, and increase of the Papists and Unitarians,
I have been struck lately with a prophecy concerning the Papists,
and moreover by a Popish priest, strange to say,
(which appeared in the London Friend for 3rd month,) it so remarkably
coincides with that of Usher as well as reminds me of L. Godfrey`'s,
both of which were in the British Friend last autumn.

These are awful times,
and wickedness and deception were surely never at such a height as now in this country,
and they must bring down Divine judgment sooner or later!
But whatever shakings and troubles and fearful sights may be in the world,
there is comfort in remembering the language, "`Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace,
whose mind is stayed on thee, because he trusteth in thee!`"
Oh! that we may then "`trust in the Lord forever;
for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength,`" bearing in mind that
the true trust implies an humble yielding to his holy power!

+++[+++The person to whom the following letter was addressed,
had since the commencement of the present troubles in our Society in New England,
voluntarily introduced to the writer the subject of the disastrous
tendency of the unsound doctrines spread among us,
and in the most unequivocal manner bore her testimony against them.
But subsequently the writer was informed that she had changed her ground,
and was giving her strength and support to those
who were sustaining said doctrines and their author,
and had come to be in full fellowship with them.

This change in one whom he had esteemed and loved so well
in the fellowship of that faith which changeth not,
produced in him a deep concern for her safe standing,
insomuch that he took two Friends with him and made her a visit at her own house.
On this occasion he reminded her of that memorable
account in Holy Writ of the command to the ministers,
the priests of the Lord, to stand firm upon the bottom of Jordan,
with the Ark of the testimony upon their shoulders until the people
had passed clean over Jordan;--that if they had despaired and thrown
the Ark of the testimony from their shoulders,
it could not be mere presumption to suppose that Jordan would have
returned and overwhelmed the priests and the people,
and consequently no stones of memorial could have been brought and set up at Gilgal!
But she attempted to vindicate her change, by saying that,
when she had testified against the unsound doctrines,
her service in that respect was accomplished;
and she believed it to be her place to associate with those who hold and support them;
and that the writer ought to have done so likewise.]

Hopkinton, 6th mo., 2nd, 1851.

[.salutation]
Dear Sophronia,

I may well so address thee,
inasmuch as the well-being and happiness of thy immortal
spirit seems to be precious indeed to me,
how then must the eternal salvation of thy soul appear to thee?
The true witness and testimony of God`'s power,
if yet alive within thee will tell thee the Truth,
if thou wilt only make a whole burnt offering of thy own will unto the Lord thy God,
he will yet, as I hope and trust, speak peace to thy soul,
and thereby put an end to the strife of tongues within thee,
and suffer thee no longer to strive with him at the fountain of bitterness,
vainly hoping in thy own way to draw sweet waters from thence, or to drink, as formerly,
of the blessed overflowing of his cup of love and of life,
when he was pleased to hand it in his own way and in his own time,
to thy great refreshment and rejoicing,
as well as to the consolation of the truly living ones in our Zion.

Well, dear friend, it is, and ever was,
an office both precious and honorable to be in the hand of the Lord a conduit through
which he may please to pour forth the holy oil--the water of life upon his heritage!
And thou hast through the mercies of the Lord,
well known that no man nor body of men can give of this
holy substance but him alone,--not even patriarchs,
nor prophets nor apostles,
nor can ten thousand of them convey the least morsel of the bread of life,
without Christ the Lord first give it to them, and commission them to give it,
when he will and to whom he will, and in such measure as he will.

And thou hast clearly seen, my dear friend,
that whatsoever has been given or attempted to be given,
without such a commission at the time, has been but poor and dry and dead,
administering no life or nourishment to a hungry soul,
and can be no better than the husks which swine feed upon.
Nor can the ministers of Christ ever devise or assign to themselves a path to walk in,
or a field of labor, though in their own apprehension more profitable,
because more extensive, than the narrow path,
or as it may appear to them the more limited ground of the Lord`'s own appointment!

Alas! for these deceived and mistaken ones; because their own contrivance,
their own devices in their own wisdom,
whilst they are distrusting the guidance of the true Shepherd, has ever,
and must always bewilder and lead them into darkness--and then feeling wise in
themselves they must needs take the lead and go before the blessed Shepherd,
and strive with him for leave to do so,
confiding in the largeness of their own capacity for receiving much and giving much,
and in their ability for the occupancy of a large field of labor.

To these, however eminently gifted they may have been,
the Lord will not give his glory nor his praise,
because they have chosen the praises of men and the friendship of the multitude,
rather than an humble and lowly walking with a crucified Saviour.
I feel a desire to call thy attention again now, at this solemn season,
in a most brotherly manner, to a suggestion of thine, when I last saw thee; to wit,
that inasmuch as thou and I both had a testimony to bear
against the unsound doctrines abroad in our Society,
that when (like thyself) I had clearly borne that testimony,
I ought then to have gone on and joined hands with
those who were upholding those unsound views!

And I would be glad to know how such reasoning looks to thee at the present time.
We know that sound argument and good reasoning were
much resorted to by the holy men of old,
by Christ and his apostles, and also by our first Friends;
but always (and never more than at the present time)
avoided by those who were disposed to support error.
The preaching and parables of Christ,
were truly an exemplification of the soundest of argument and of divine reasoning,
as were the Lord`'s testimonies by all the prophets and apostles; and I would ask,
did his or their practice ever contradict their testimonies?
Did the prophets, after they had faithfully warned the people against idolatry,
go hand in hand with them up to their house of worship?
What an extensive field of labor stood open to Elijah and Micaiah,
would they only have associated with those great
multitudes of priests and worshippers of Baal.

Nay, rather than to dishonor God by such an association and fellowship,
they would be driven to the most solitary situation and to prison.
But had those who had once testified against idolatry,
now joined in fellowship with its worshippers,
how greatly would their example have strengthened such an heresy;
and how displeasing in the sight of God,
that the messengers whom he had chosen and sent to preach against heresy,
should join in fellowship with the abettors of it!
When our worthy predecessors, the first Friends,
testified against the errors of the formal professors, they came out from them,
and never again associated with them.

But, is there not yet a ray of hope for thee, that although thou hast,
without good reason, thrown the Ark of the Lord`'s testimonies from thy shoulders,
where himself in abundant mercy had caused it to rest,
is there not a way yet left thee whereby the Lord will deign by his almighty
power and through his tender love to recover it for thee,
if thou wilt in all submission fall down at his feet in the needful self-abasement,
so that the waters of Jordan may not return until thou hast passed clean over!
Oh! feel for the bottom thereof with weeping and with prayer and fasting,
beseeching of Him who died for us that he would forgive thee,
and give thee thy feet again, and strength to step forward through this mighty river,
so essential to be waded by all the inhabitants of the holy city,
or I fear it will overwhelm thee.

That a victory may be thy happy experience,
is the sincere desire and prayer of the writer of these lines;
and whether attained or not, one thing I believe to be possible,
for thee to avouch the testimony again which thy Redeemer once gave thee to bear against
those pernicious sentiments that have so lamentably scattered the Lord`'s people.
And remember, I entreat thee, how much help to the Lord`'s cause,
and how well pleasing to him would be such a renewed testimony against those sad doctrines
which have so sorrowfully divided us in Jacob and scattered us in Israel.

I should be truly glad to hear from thee and how it is with thee every way.

From thy affectionate friend and true well wisher,

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

There is need of faithful standard-bearers amongst us,
for there seemed at this Yearly Meeting, but a mere handful on the women`'s side,
who would put a spoke in the wheel for the Truth!
We missed dear +++_______+++ +++_______+++ and +++_______+++ +++_______+++ much, so that H. M.,
R+++.+++ R. and L. C. were the only ones that took any active part on the ancient side;
as for my poor self, I am so deaf I am of little use,
yet was mercifully enabled to lift up my vocal trumpet twice in our sittings,
and twice in the select ones, to my relief and peace however unworthy.
We were favored, I thought, with more of quiet this year than sometimes;
perhaps the presence (or rather inward,
deep travail of spirit) of the two dear Philadelphia
Friends might have an overawing effect,
and tend to keep down the light and chaffy;
for some that are rather light-weighted were wholly silent!
But poor A. B. nothing checks her, and she spoke some days ten times,
so as even to try some of the junior class, as I heard!

I had hoped that Philadelphia Yearly Meeting would have made a stand this year,
but I suppose the conservative influence was too strong;
and then they are losing some valiants such as dear Christopher Healy;
so that I fear lest weakness may overtake all that Yearly Meeting,
and it may sink into the common mass of modified Quakers and carry Ohio with it!
Our own state is deplorable indeed,
and becoming more and more vile in the estimation of the world,
who now justly look upon us as a sect like others; and so it would seem we are,
seeing in a mass we are so greatly degenerated and
gone back to the door of the house of bondage,
and the outer court whence our forefathers were brought out,
to partake of the true liberty and pure life and holy worship of the inner temple!

It would be a great comfort to meet in a little purified capacity as you do,
but our time is not yet fully come to be delivered;
and we must not rush forward in our own creaturely will or wisdom,
lest the query should go forth, "`Who hath required this at your hand?`"
I believe we are rapidly drawing nearer and nearer a precipice,
by which we may get clear of our encumbering oppression,
but in what way I do not yet see--certainly not by the Episcopalians
seeing their error and returning to first principles;
such a thing is not at all likely.
We have a committee of six to visit Scotland,
from the Yearly Meeting expected at our General Meeting next month.

But alas! human wisdom is set to work in the nomination of these committees;
and then man`'s convenience, riches, will, or influence is looked at,
instead of the qualifications of the spirit of Christ--the
judgment and discernment for the Truth;
so what can we expect!
Oh! that we may be graciously permitted to meet in the heavenly country,
where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest!

[.letter-heading]
To Benjamin Seebohm, Respected Friend,

When thou called at our house, thy time, as it appeared, did not admit, as I desired,
of a personal conversation upon the unhappy dissension and interruption
of harmony which has of late so troubled the Society of Friends.
And inasmuch as a concern has rested with me,
not only on account of the perilous condition in
which the church under our name has become involved;
but on thy account as an individual,
and the part thou hast been reported to have taken and acted,
in supporting the ground and cause of the dissension so rife in the Society,
I saw no way (under the circumstance of thy having so soon
embarked for England) for the relief of my own mind,
but this, of resorting to pen and paper.
I have many times quietly passed over its revival,
under an apprehension that probably I might, in time, feel clear in the omission of it;
but now, after so much time has elapsed,
I still feel the conviction that it will not only conduce to the peace of my own mind,
to address thee on the subject, but that the time for it has come,
however incompetent I am to do justice to the great and good cause.

First then, my friend,
thou wilt not presume to plead ignorance or the want of understanding
the ground and occasion of trouble in our Society.
The original doctrines of Friends have been indefinitely called in question,
and declared defective, by a late noted writer of the Society in thy own country;
and not only so,
many of those doctrines have been severally perverted by the same writer;
and his views thereon have been sent to all parts of the Society
for their reception instead of the original doctrines of Friends,
thereby gainsaying those of Fox, Barclay, Penn, and Penington;
and assuming himself to be wiser than they in relation to the things of God`'s kingdom,
his way and means of redemption and of man`'s salvation,
and thus controverting many of the doctrines approved
by the whole body of those deeply proved,
largely qualified, and highly experienced Friends of the early days of the Society,
whose doctrines were clearly proved to be in perfect conformity with the sacred volume,
and whose views had also been sanctioned by the Society,
not only individually but collectively,
by the respective Yearly Meetings for nearly two centuries.

It is no creditable thing then for an individual of our time,
to suppose himself better qualified to define the doctrines of Truth, than they were,
and to come forward subsequently to their leaving the stage of action
in this world to promulgate different sentiments from theirs in the Society.
But for this writer to assume the right of controverting the ancient Friends`' doctrine,
and at the same time to deny every body the right of controverting his own,
seems very unfair and absurd.
And the rigorous way of dealing,
and the perversion of judgment that was meted out
to those who thought they had a better right,
and were under greater obligation, to make a stand against the new doctrines,
than he had to gainsay those of George Fox and his friends,
sufficiently proves the degenerate condition of those authorities which,
though in want of principle,
were not in want of disposition to visit persecution upon honest
Friends for their faithfulness to the ancient doctrine.

No better evidence, therefore,
need be adduced to prove that such are disciples of the author of those new doctrines,
and that the doctrines themselves, and the practical results of them,
are not very strikingly marked with Christianity--a
corollary which stands in no fear of being refuted.
Nor can it be supposed by the part thou hast taken in this country so decidedly,
and for so long a time, that thou would be in any way inclined to deny,
or disposed to refute the proposition,
that the larger body in New England are proselytes to the new doctrines;
on which ground alone, either their course, or thy own, can be accounted for.

It has been shown, by the most authentic and able public documents, that thy countryman,
aforesaid, has advanced and published sentiments perversive of the principles of Friends,
as above stated,
and it is clear that such sentiments have been so
largely imbibed by the members of our Society,
and adopted by so many,
as to produce the sad disunity that exists so extensively within its borders.
Hence we see something of the immense responsibility,
if not of the condemnation that must have rested upon the author of those views,
not merely because of the disunity,
but because of the apostasy of principle that has
been consequent upon the dissemination of such sentiments.
Inasmuch then as (like Jeroboam) he has caused Israel to sin, his accountability is great.

Howbeit, the condemnation that rests upon him, does not acquit those who,
(like Adam from Eve,) have received the forbidden fruit from his hands.
But the degree of condemnation, we are taught,
must be in proportion to the measure of light and
knowledge which the receiver had been favored with.
He that has known the blessed effects and operations
of the life and power of Truth upon his own heart,
and has through the obedience of faith profited by such favor to
the drawing of the inner man into the newness of life,
if he afterwards become so beguiled by the enemy, through man`'s wisdom, or otherwise,
as to fall from this condition, and to step aside from the restraints of the narrow way,
and like other professors, to look more to the letter than to the power of the Spirit,
then is he prepared to receive the new doctrine and
to throw off the restraints of the cross of Christ.

Such an one having departed from his former good
experience and enlisted into the new views,
is not unlikely to become very zealous in propagating them, and if so,
may in time be exceedingly reprehensible;
and especially if his heart become so callous toward
his brother that holds fast to the Truth,
that he is even capable of enmity or persecution.
Then he that imparteth and he that receiveth of such fruit become of one cast,
and if the receiver do all in his power to promote
the views and interests of him who imparteth,
his accountability must be the same in kind if not in degree.

But it hath been said, and I think with good reason, that thy countryman,
above referred to, has done more harm to the Society of Friends,
than any other individual in that land had ever done since its first organization.
Now, my friend, let us consider the responsibility of the ministers of Christ,
and how solemn the inquiry and consideration of how far
we have been fulfilling such high and holy calling,
purely under his leading and direction.
But I must say to thee that I do feel constrained by the requirements of such a calling,
which can be exercised only in the love of Christ for the help of one another,
(and should be in honesty and plainness of speech,
and in such language as truth dictates,) and in great meekness it is,
that I want to ask thee,
whether thou hast not in the course of thy long visit here in America,
labored industriously to support the cause of the new doctrines
and the interest of those who have identified themselves with them,
and in sustaining the character of their author as
a minister of the gospel in our Society?

And if such be the case,
(to which I am persuaded thou wilt accede,) I feel bound to say to thee
that I fear an immense weight of responsibility rests upon thee! and that
nothing short of sincere repentance can avail thee of the blessed favor
of becoming reconciled to God by the death of his Son,
that so being reconciled thou may by his life be saved from the judgments to come!
Oh! my friend, if the New Testament is true,
and the doctrines of our first Friends (so entirely conformable thereto) are true,
then J. J. Gurney was wrong, and promulgated many palpable and dangerous errors,
which if adopted and supported by those who have once known the Truth as it is in Jesus,
must expose them to great condemnation.

His efforts to destroy our faith in one of the great fundamentals of Christianity
and of primitive Quakerism (by his own attempted translation of the Greek version
of those passages in Holy Writ so plain and irrefragable in demonstration of
the blessed doctrine of Christ in man the hope of glory--Christ the true light,
etc.) was painful to honest Friends, resorting, as he did,
to such perversions as even our enemies in George Fox`'s time, did not resort to.

Aberdeen, 12th, 11th mo., 1851.

It would be a relief to a remnant here could we also be outwardly united together,
but our numbers are so small, and decreasing rapidly,
that we can only mourn in secret! and I fear since
the visits of the late travellers from New England,
that their influence and preaching tends to this decrease;
they have been greatly extolled,
and by such as I should have thought would have seen or felt through them better!
They came here when I was in the North, in the 9th mo.,
and I was not sorry to escape them.

Ah!
I cannot think well of a holding up our ancient Friends
and apparently preaching of old doctrines,
if there be not a testimony felt and upheld against J. J. Gurney`'s doctrines;
it seems to me inconsistent, however plausible things may appear!
I should have thought the sound Friends of Philadelphia would have
seen through that contrivance of the leading conservatives to shut
out the reading of your document last year;
it is what we have for some years been suffering from! whatever is not
relished in upper quarters has the extinguisher placed on it thus,
whether it be a ministerial testimony or a disciplinary proposition!
But they should have introduced it again,
for such hasty doings are against our principle of waiting for Divine direction!

I fear the Friends thereaway will learn all our bad ways,
and thus bring great suffering to the honest-hearted, great hurt to the young,
(notwithstanding all their plausible endeavors to the contrary,)
and great hinderance to the cause of Truth,
and I fear it will be in vain the honest-hearted
waiting till others are removed by death;
for like begets its like,
and the work of baptizing into a similar conservative
or unsound spirit is going on apace the while!
And the dear Friends of Ohio,
oh! how undesirable for them to be pinning their faith upon the sleeve of the Philadelphians!
it will not do to be leaning so on a reverend father or dear friend;
thus the true plumbness for the cause is lost and
weakness rushes in like a mighty torrent.

May the Lord preserve the faithful, humble ones in your land,
wherever scattered and however tried! and when thou art favored with breathing heavenward,
crave the help of the little remnant of tried ones in this land!

In that precious bond which death has no power over,
I remain thy nearly united and affectionate friend,
