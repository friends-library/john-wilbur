== Preliminary Chapter.

John Wilbur was the son of Thomas and Mary Wilbur, of Hopkinton,
in the State of Rhode Island, and was born there on the 17th of the 7th month, 1774.
His parents were religiously concerned to bring up their
children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,
in accordance with the principles of the religious Society of Friends,
of which they were exemplary members.

It is to be regretted that few particulars of his early life can now be collected,
and that, in his own account, he alluded to this period with but a passing remark;
perhaps owing to his natural aversion to speaking much in regard to himself.

It appears that from his youth upwards he was sober and religiously inclined;
and was indeed remarkable for his decorum and gravity at an early age;
being concerned for the prosperity of truth,
and measurably qualified to advocate the principles of Friends, when but a boy.
When he was ten years of age,
hearing an individual advance sentiments which he thought
were not according to the doctrines of the New Testament,
he so ably expressed and defended his own faith and understanding of the Holy Scriptures,
as to put the man to silence,
who afterwards expressed his astonishment that so
young a boy should be so qualified with capacity.
When still younger than this, a professor of another religious persuasion meeting him,
abruptly accosted him with the query: "`Who is head of your church?`"
To which he promptly replied: "`Christ;`" and the man said no more.

The religious concern of his parents, not only to advise and instruct their children,
but also to restrain them in a Christian spirit from things
which they believed to be inconsistent with the truth,
and the blessed effect attendant on this godly parental care,
were often adverted to by him in after-life, as cause for great thankfulness,
with the expression also of a fear, that in this day of great liberty and laxity,
too many were neglecting their offspring in this respect,
and not administering suitable counsel and restraint.
On this account he was often brought into exercise and travail for the dear youth;
and his concern for their right bringing up never appeared to be in any degree abated,
but rather increased to the end of his days.
It may here be mentioned, as closely connected with the above remarks,
(though out of date,) that within two years of his decease,
at his own Quarterly Meeting of Rhode Island,
having requested to have the shutters opened between the men`'s and women`'s meetings,
he held forth, in an impressive and memorable manner,
the great importance of maintaining all our testimonies,
enlarging in expression to the beloved young people,
but particularly pressing upon parents the right training of their children,
earnestly and in great brokenness, even unto tears, exhorting them to seek for ability,
through Divine help, to keep their children within the safe enclosure;
reminding them of the necessity not only of good example and precept,
but of restraint also;
that children cannot realize the danger of breaking through the hedge,
and if allowed to do so, the sad result would be chargeable to such parents;
adding that he could not be clear without thus expostulating with them,
seeing that it might be the last opportunity he should have,
and desiring to be clear of the blood of all.
The effect was deeply impressive, and the opportunity memorable to those present.

At the age of eighteen, he commenced to teach school,
and followed that occupation more or less for several years,
to the satisfaction of those who employed him.
In a letter written by him about this time to a friend,
his remarks on the need of strict watchfulness and faith in Christ Jesus,
in connection with the responsible duties of a teacher,
exhibit a maturity of sentiment and experience far beyond his years.

In the year 1793 he was united in marriage to Lydia,
daughter of Amos and Thankful Collins, of Stonington, Connecticut;
a union which continued in unabated harmony and affection nearly sixty years.
In the early part of his married life, he had many trials and conflicts,
being in limited pecuniary circumstances,
and his health for several years being somewhat delicate;
which caused him at times to labor under much discouragement in
regard to a due provision for the comfort of his increasing family.
And he has been heard to say that in his first setting out in the world,
there were times when he had some desire for accumulating property,
but that all his undertakings with this view were unsuccessful;
and he believed it was so ordered in divine wisdom, and designed to him as a blessing.
Yet was he favored with ability from time to time "`to provide things honest
in the sight of all men,`" experiencing the promise fulfilled which was given
to them who seek first the kingdom of heaven and the righteousness thereof,
that all things needful should be added.

He was appointed to the station of Elder, at the age of twenty-eight years,
some time previous to his appearing in public ministry.
Great mental conflict was his portion before he came forth in this weighty service.
While under the preparing Hand, he had a lingering illness of several months`' duration;
wherein his medical attendant and friends feared he was going into a decline;
but he manifested great composure and resignation, remarking to his wife,
that his dependence was not on physicians for help, but on Him who was able to restore,
if in his wisdom He saw fit.
His trials, doubtless, had a deepening effect on his mind,
and were sanctified to his growth and establishment in the blessed Truth,
and to the promotion of his subsequent usefulness.
Soon after his recovery, he appeared in the ministry, to the satisfaction of his friends;
and continuing faithful and watchful,
his gift was officially acknowledged by his Monthly and Quarterly Meetings,
in the year 1812.
