[short="Chapter III"]
== Chapter III. First Visit to Europe, During the Years 1831, 1832, and 1833.

About the year 1817,
I began to feel gentle drawings in my mind towards Friends in England,
but the opening seemed so small and so distant,
that I took very little notice of it for a long time; but as years passed on,
it continued at times to revive and spring up in my mind, and though seldom,
yet generally with an increased impression and of longer duration;
so that in the course of seven or eight years,
I began to be convinced that it would some day or other be required
of me to go over the sea and pay a visit to the seed there,
in that love which seemed more powerfully springing up in my mind,
and was now also enlarged towards Scotland and Ireland,
though in a less degree than towards England.

But even after these strong impressions,
the prospect did sometimes disappear for many months,
and then would come to me again with greater clearness and fulness than ever;
and so it was until about two years before my liberation,
when it became almost the continual companion of my mind,
and at times with great weight and power;
insomuch that I now ventured to open it to my dear wife,
for as yet the Lord alone had knowledge of this his own dealing with me,
and wherein he was requiring obedience.
As to the outward, such an undertaking for me seemed to look very difficult;
but when the concern increased and grew strong in me,
I was not left to doubt His power who was calling me to this service
in making a way for the fulfillment of his will.

And now the weight of the exercise that rested upon me was such that I felt constrained
to open my mind to some judicious Friends for their counsel herein,
and meeting with no discouragement from them, in the 12th month, 1830,
I laid my concern before our Monthly Meeting of South Kingston,
and at their next Meeting received their certificate of concurrence and full unity,
which was endorsed by our Quarterly Meeting of Rhode Island in the 5th month following,
and the good unity of our Yearly Meeting of Ministers
and Elders in the 6th month being also obtained,
and set forth in their concurring certificate,
I engaged a passage on board the ship Birmingham, a packet of 570 tons burden,
to sail from New York on the 24th of 7th month, 1831, for Liverpool.

And now, these preliminary steps being taken,
my mind was introduced into the consideration and sense
of my own unworthiness to be sent on such a mission,
as well as my utter want of ability to perform the service
that may be called for at my hands in a strange land.
Nor can my friends at home,
however near their feelings of sympathy or fervent their desires and prayers,
give that qualification which is indispensable in
order to be rightly employed on such a mission.
Yet I have so much assurance in the sympathy and prayers of the faithful,
that I believe strength and encouragement is really
at times derived from the remembrance of them,
and their good desires for us;
but I am abundantly persuaded that this is not to be our food on all occasions.

The Lord Jesus Christ is the Head of the Church--our Shepherd and our High Priest,
as well as Minister of his ministers,
and goeth before and guideth his messengers whithersoever he sends them.
And O, saith my soul, that I may now in this great undertaking,
remember continually my own nothingness and insufficiency to do
anything that will contribute to the promotion of his cause,
or the glory of his name, except He be with me and help me.
Then may I endeavor to dwell near him, and be very low before him,
watching unto prayer continually.
In company with my dear wife, two of our sons, and brother Abel Collins,
I left home on the 20th of 7th month, 1831, for New York, my friend,
Joshua Gardner also going with us as far as New London,
from whence he and my youngest son returned;
and the rest of us took stage for Connecticut River,
and from thence by steamboat for New York, where we arrived at ten o`'clock next morning,
and were kindly received by our friend Samuel Wood and family,
who very obligingly assisted me in preparing for the voyage.

Here we met with our dear children, William and Mary Hazard, from Dutchess County,
and our brother and sister, Rowland and Mary Hazard,
who very kindly came down with them to see me before sailing,
and whose company and attention was truly grateful.
We called on divers Friends in the city, to see and take leave of them, until first day,
the 24th, when, having got all things ready,
I had a very solid parting opportunity with my beloved wife and children, brothers,
sister, and near friends at Samuel Wood`'s house.
Our feelings, I believe, were truly mutual,
and a door was opened into the house of prayer,
and unfeigned intercessions were put up to our Holy Helper,
that he would be pleased to palliate and make easy this great conflict
of parting with everything in this world heretofore known,
and craving the preservation and protection of wife and children,
connections and friends.

After this solid and affecting season, many Friends accompanied us to the pier,
and about fourteen in number, went with me on board the ship,
which lay in the harbor about six miles from the wharf,
where we parted in a most affectionate and tender manner,
commending each other to God and to the word of his grace,
not knowing that we should ever meet again in this world.

My dear wife, children, and friends now returning to the city,
and the ship being soon under weigh, we got immediately out to sea;
passed the bar about two o`'clock p.m. with a fair wind.
On losing sight of the American continent, which we did the same afternoon,
and finding myself on the bosom of the mighty deep,
my mind was led into a train of solemn reflections; regarding myself,
(a lonely messenger,) and the probable result of
the mission on which I had now embarked in very deed,
without any probability of stopping short of the shores of Europe,
unless the Lord by his providence interpose,
and by his ministers the winds and waves turn our course another way,
or hide us in his great treasury beneath the mighty waters.

I said in my heart, however unworthy I am to be called one of the least of thy disciples,
yet now Lord I have cast myself wholly into thy hands; carry me whither Thou pleasest,
and dispose of me as Thou wilt,
and I will endeavor to be resigned to thy righteous disposal.
But now, indeed, is the time, the power,
and proof of the conflict;--a stranger to all on board--not one among
the passengers or crew to whom it would be safe to open my tried mind,
or availing to look for sympathy of feeling or the imparting of counsel.
My friends at home have done all they can for me at the present time,
unless the prayers of a few congenial spirits should follow me hence,
to which I feel that I have scarcely a claim, and which I do not merit.
It is on the mercies of the Lord alone that I now rely for
preservation and a little faith to sustain me whilst,
though in the world I seem so completely separated from it,
or suspended between the two,--(the eastern and the western,) or
it may be awfully between this and that which is to come!

Or am I placed, though remotely, between the floor and the field of offering?
If, indeed, this dreary and painful travel should in time, by his grace,
lead me to where the dews shall distil and the rains descend,
then will I praise the Lord my preserver!
Yea, I will praise him even now.
Will I not praise him in the depth as well as in the height?
If not the "`most,`" yet will I bless thee in "`the severe;`" yea,
though sickness depress my animal spirits, and nature melt at the loss of a tender wife,
precious children, and near friends,
so that I am left to bemoan my condition as a man of sorrows,
and have literally watered my couch with my tears,
still I will bless and praise the name of the Lord
for his hand has hitherto been seen to be underneath;
and when I shall have sufficiently learned,
(as I am now instructed by necessity,) to trust wholly in Him and
to love him alone,--to withdraw my affections from things below,
then do I hope to find him what he ever was,--a present helper in the needful time.

And although I have found the utmost necessity for looking unto the God
and Father of all my sure mercies for support under these trials,
still I have my apprehension that the time may come
wherein I may be more tried and straitened,
if it should fall to my lot to turn the battle to the gate
in that land where my prospect seems leading me,
and wherein a more near dwelling with the Fountain of wisdom
will be needful in order to bear the shield discreetly,
to the supporting and exalting of the standard of everlasting righteousness
than I even now feel in the midst of these afflictions.

I suffered much from sea-sickness through most of the passage,
the duration of which was twenty-six days;
but the ship`'s company and passengers were not only civil to me,
but respectful and even kind;
so that my situation was as comfortable as could
have been expected under the circumstances attending;
and I have thought that the affectionate parting opportunity with my friends on board,--their
apparent respectability and solid deportment tended in some degree to turn attention
towards me,--the occurrence was several times alluded to by the passengers.

I arrived safely at Liverpool on the 19th of 8th month,
and found my way to the house of my kind friend Thomas Thompson,
to whom my letters of introduction were addressed.
My certificates were sent to London for the adjudication
of the Meeting for Sufferings there,
and until their return, which was about ten days,
I stayed in and about Liverpool--attended meetings for worship five times,
and was silent in all except one, when I spoke a few words only.
During this time, I also attended their Monthly Meeting, now held at Hardshaw,
in which I had a short testimony.

8th mo., 29th. I left Liverpool in company with Thomas Thompson,
who has given up to bear me company for a time,
and went to Penketh and had a meeting there.
It was this meeting that Samuel Fothergill used to attend;
and it was here his remains were interred.
This was a satisfactory meeting, though small;
and after it we went to Warrington and lodged with Robert and Ann Gilpin,
and breakfasted at Joseph Fell`'s,
who lives in the house formerly owned and occupied by Samuel Fothergill.
Here we had a favorable meeting on the 30th,
and after meeting examined some ancient documents
contained in their close--these were very interesting;
being certificates out and returning of divers valuable and ancient Friends,
as well as some of later time.
After meeting we dined at Ann Milner`'s,
and then went to West Houghton and lodged at James Hodkinson`'s.

31st. We had a meeting here of Friends and others,
wherein strength was given to unfold some of the doctrines of the Gospel.
It was a solid time; and near the conclusion, way was opened to the house of prayer.
From this place we went to Manchester,
and lodged at the house of my kind friend William Boulton.
9th mo., 1st. Attended their week-day meeting, in which my mouth was opened in a short,
searching testimony to such as were not walking according
to the knowledge they had received,
who, according to our Lord`'s declaration, are subjects for stripes and correction.
In conclusion, some comfort was administered to the faithful.
2nd. Went to Oldham, and had, after a pretty long silence, an open,
heart-searching meeting, in which I believe many minds, if not all,
were humbled and tendered; and after this went again to Manchester,
and next day rested and wrote.

4th. Attended their fore and afternoon meetings, which were, from some cause,
rather painful to me.
I attempted, however, some public service in each, which brought little peace.
5th. Went to Bolton, and had a solid meeting there, in which I felt peace;
after which went to Rochdale, and lodged at James Midgley`'s. Abigail Dockray,
wife of D. D. of Manchester, came with us from that place,
in order to attend the meeting here, and at Bolton;
and her company has been acceptable to us.
6th. Had a meeting here, in which A. D. had good service,
and was followed by an attempt at some labor on my part,
but it proved a day of deep distress to me; after meeting, we dined at James King`'s.

The day before I landed at Liverpool, and near where we passed,
a steam vessel called the Rothsay Castle was lost,
and one hundred of her passengers perished, among whom were two Friends from this place;
one of them a brother of James King,
whose widow was now here--but his body has not yet been found; the other a cousin of his,
by the name of Bottomly, whose body was found, brought here, and buried two days since;
his parents, three brothers and two sisters, were also here--a plain,
good-looking family of Friends.
A+++.+++ D. had an open time with them,
but I could be no more than their silent companion in tribulation.
From this place we went to Todmorden, and lodged at Joshua B. Fielding`'s, where,
on fourth day, we had a silent meeting--still in a tried and low state;
and religion appears to me to be pretty low here.

After meeting went to Crawshawbooth, took tea at John Dockray`'s,
and lodged at Mary and Susanna Haworth`'s. 8th. Still distressed.
O Lord, how long wilt thou charge me with iniquity, and hide thyself from me?
Wilt thou cover me with darkness, even forever!
Wilt thou command thy light to shine no more upon me,
and destroy me in thy great displeasure!
Wilt thou not suffer me, O God, to look unto thee, and again to hope in thee?
O that thou would wash me from all iniquity, and suffer me once more to praise thee!
Attended meeting here--had a little light, like a glimmer passing a window,
and towards the close of the meeting, spoke a few words,
but soon sank down again into deep affliction.
I went, this afternoon, to Marsden, and lodged at Hannah Ecroyd`'s, where, next day,
we had a silent meeting; after which we went to Blackburn, and had an evening meeting,
in which a degree of relief came,
and in a short testimony my mouth was opened to the few Friends here.
10th. Went to Preston, and lodged at Ralph Alderson`'s;
and next day attended their meeting, both fore and afternoon,
to pretty good satisfaction.
My companion, T. T., left me here, and took stage for Liverpool.

12th. Michael Saterthwaite bearing me company, went to Standish,
where we expected a meeting had been appointed for us,
but found that the information had failed; so we went on for the next appointment,
and lodged at the house of Charles Holmes, called Oriel Hall.
Near this place is a nunnery, having about sixty inmates,
the first of whom came from France; but the law now prohibits their increase.

13th. We had a little meeting at Ashton with Friends and others,
among whom was a clergyman of the Episcopal order,
with whom we had considerable conversation after meeting, he appearing friendly.
Went, the same evening, to Liverpool, and attended their Monthly Select Meeting,
and next day, 14th, their Monthly Meeting, and in the evening,
the Select Quarterly Meeting; in all which it was my lot to be silent.
15th. Attended the Quarterly Meeting at large,
through the course of which my mental sufferings were very great.
There was much preaching during the meeting for worship, in which I had no part,
and which, according to my sense,
had but very little solemnizing effect upon the meeting.
O Lord, preserve me in the patience, and enable me to resign all to thy disposal;
O keep me from the snare of the fowler, and set thy mercy round about me,
lest I fall and reproach thy holy name.
O, enable me to trust in thee forever.

On sixth day, the 16th of 9th month, in company with my beloved friend George Crosfield,
I left Liverpool again, and went towards Cheshire; travelled twenty miles,
and lodged at our friend Ralph Neild`'s. 17th. Had a little open meeting at Franly,
in Cheshire; after which we dined at William Derbyshire`'s. His wife,
whose maiden name was Bradbury, has several sisters in the State of New York.
From hence we went to Stockport, to the house of my dear friends George and Ann Jones.
On first day, the 18th, we attended their meeting in the morning,
to pretty good satisfaction, and another in the evening for the townspeople,
which was very full, and was a laborious time;
there seemed but little room in the minds of many here to receive the testimony of truth,
yet it was hoped that there were some who felt the weight of things delivered.

19th. Went to Macclesfield, and had a meeting there,
in which I believe some Gospel truths were testified to, and it proved a solid time;
after which we went into Staffordshire, to Leek,
and lodged at Toft Chorley`'s. It was at this place that Margaret Lucas lived,
and experienced her close trials and sufferings, at the time of her convincement.
Toft Chorley is a grandson of Joshua Toft, mentioned in her narrative.
The meeting here was rather trying and laborious;
for a considerable time silent and very discouraging;
it seemed very difficult to speak rightly to the conditions of the few,
(for there were but a few,) yet a variety of condition
was very apparent to the mingled feelings of my mind;
but by endeavoring to dwell deep, way was at length made, as I trust,
to divide aright the word of truth among them, in which I found peace.

After this meeting we travelled twenty-five miles to Nantwich, in Cheshire,
and lodged at Croudson Tunstall`'s,
where we met with a number of Friends from divers places at which we had been.
21st. We attended Monthly Meeting here in the morning,
wherein the virtue and sap of the divine life was joyfully felt to circulate,
and Zion`'s travellers were encouraged to hold on their way.
In the evening, attended the Select Quarterly Meeting for Cheshire and Staffordshire,
which consisted, at this time, of four members only;
but we were informed that there are eleven belonging to it--some sick, and some away.
We returned to C. T.`'s and lodged.

22nd. Attended the Quarterly Meeting at large, which, though small,
was nevertheless a time of especial favor,
and I trust many minds were tendered and encouraged to press forward;
and solemn supplication ascended as incense from the altar of our hearts.
After this meeting we travelled twenty four miles to Morley,
and tarried at John Barlow`'s, where, next day,
we attended their meeting--dull and painful,
on account of lukewarmness and carnal security in too many present;
to whom an alarm was sounded near the conclusion of the meeting.
After this meeting we went again to Stockport,
and lodged at George Jones`'s.

Stockport, in the county of Cheshire, 9th mo., 23rd, 1831.

[.salutation]
My Dear Wife And Children,

I have been thinking so much of you this afternoon that I cannot omit writing you.
I have not yet received any information from you since I left America--have been greatly
in expectation of a letter for more than a week past--saw a Liverpool paper last night
which stated that the packet ship S. Jenkins came round Holyhead on second day last,
by which I can hardly help hoping that I may yet have a letter.
I have written three letters to America since coming
to this country--the first to Moses Brown,
for you, the second, to Samuel Wood, for you, and the third to Thomas Wilbur, Fall River,
to be sent home also.
This place is about forty miles from Liverpool;
have visited most of the meetings in Lancashire and Cheshire.
After writing you last,
(about two weeks since,) I went again to Liverpool
and attended the Quarterly Meeting there,
after which, in company with my beloved friend, George Crosfield, sat out for Cheshire,
where we have had a number of meetings, some of which have been highly favored seasons.
I have had of late great confirmation of its being right for me to be in this land,
and at this time;
although I had to endure much grievous affliction
for the first two or three weeks after arriving here,
not of body, but of mind, which I endeavored to submit to with patience,
believing it might be an essential preparatory baptism for future service;
but my mind has been set greatly at liberty for the week past,
in which my cords have been lengthened and my stakes strengthened.
My companion is much more than an ordinary man,
and although a Liverpool merchant of shining talents,
is still endowed with so much meekness and tenderness that his
company and help in this weighty work is truly acceptable and useful.
He is an Elder of clear discernment and a judicious companion.
How long he will stay with me is uncertain; his wife met with us at Nantwich,
and manifested much tender feeling for me.
So much time having elapsed and not hearing from you,
I begin to think that something serious has transpired
which you may deem improper for me yet to know;
but be that as it may, I am endeavoring to be resigned to the will of Divine Providence,
and as I did commit and resign you most solemnly into his hand and holy keeping,
I confide in the belief that He will yet be merciful both to you
and me amid the sorrows and privations of our separation;
and truly one of the most fruitful desires of my heart is now in
the exercise of this arduous service in a foreign land,
that you may live and devote your all to Him who has ordered our separation,
and continue to be resigned to his will until he
shall be pleased to restore us to each other again;
and if this be your experience I believe your hearts
will be made to overflow with his love,
and his kind and propitious eye will be over you, causing your peace to flow as a river,
which is my chiefest desire for you.

--

24th. On seventh day we travelled through a corner of Derbyshire,
thirty-six miles to Sheffield, in Yorkshire,
and lodged at the house of our kind friend William Hargreaves,
whose daughter Lydia is a minister, and were received very affectionately.
On first day we attended their large meeting here, both fore and afternoon.
The first was truly an overshadowing time even in the silent part of it;
and in this respect, as I think, has been surpassed by few, if any,
which it has been my lot to attend, and the latter was also a good meeting.
On second day, with William Hargreaves, Jr., for our guide,
we went to Doncaster and had a meeting there,
in which the doctrine of the fall of man and his redemption was pretty fully set forth;
as also the necessity of seeing our lapse and depravity,
in order to realize the all importance of the sacrifice
of Christ and the power of the Gospel;
and strength was mercifully given to bring the subject
home to the awakening of many minds.
Here live our valuable elder friends William and Martha Smith, ministers in good esteem.
The salutation of her spirit was truly animating to mine;
and answered as face answereth to face in a glass.

26th. From Doncaster we went to Ackworth, and lodged at the school;
and next morning had a religious opportunity with the scholars;
then left and went to the city of York,
and attended their Select Quarterly Meeting the same evening at six o`'clock,
in a very low state of mind.
28th. The Quarterly Meeting was very large, and there was much preaching,
so that room was hardly found for a poor foreign messenger
to deal out his humble ware till towards the close;
but I was pretty well satisfied in the end.
There were two sittings of the meeting for discipline;
the latter held till nine o`'clock in the evening, through which I sat in much weakness,
and continued in a state of great desertion until next morning,
when at ten o`'clock another public meeting was held,
wherein my weakness was turned into strength and Truth was raised into dominion.

After the Quarterly Meeting was over,
we visited their institution for the insane called the Retreat;
which gives full proof of the benevolence and humanity of its founders and supporters.
The most soothing attention to the wants of the inmates and the strictest cleanliness,
are observed.
The same day we went to see Hannah Murray, widow of the late Lindley Murray, of Holdgate,
near York.
With her I had a very satisfactory and interesting visit.
30th. We left York and travelled forty miles to Burlington,
on the eastern coast of Yorkshire, and the place where our ancient friend,
John Richardson, once lived.

Here we had a meeting the next day with the few Friends who live at this place,
and one or two others; and although the number assembled, I think,
did not exceed a dozen persons, it was truly a savory season,
and the language of encouragement to greater faithfulness was extended,
and a sweet offering of incense was graciously prepared for us.
After meeting, we made two or three calls in a solid way,
and then travelled eighteen miles to Scarborough,
and went to the house of our friends John and Martha Yeardley,
both ministers who have been several times on the continent on religious service.
Here we saw the ruins of the old Castle, in which our ancient worthy, George Fox,
suffered much hardship in a cruel and long imprisonment.
This town and that from which we last came, are situated upon the German Ocean.

First day, 10th mo.,
2nd. Attended their meeting in the morning--rather
heavy--and in the evening had one with the town`'s-people,
which we thought a favored time.
3rd. We went to Knapton and had a meeting there--to
this place we were guided by Robert Tindal,
who, with his brothers,
owns an estate here of nearly three thousand acres of excellent land,
on which there are four houses for public worship, one of which is for Friends,
all built by the owners of the estate, they being of different denominations.
Here, at their mansion-house, called Tindal Hall,
we were kindly accommodated with breakfast and dinner.

After this, we went to Malton, and had a meeting at five o`'clock,
and lodged at Joseph Priestman`'s, who went with us next day to Pickering,
where we had a meeting with Friends.
These last two were long silent and rather laborious,
but strength was given towards the close, as I trust, to stir up the pure mind in many.
After the last mentioned, in company with J. Priestman,
we travelled twenty-one miles to Whitby.
Here, next day, we had a meeting,
in which a subject came unexpectedly into view and was pretty fully treated
on--it was concerning the exalted character of Jesus Christ our Lord,
his mission and mediation--his having done much for us without us;
and procured for us also the gift of the good spirit within us.

I was informed, before we left, that a Unitarian preacher was present in the meeting.
Afternoon, travelled to Castleton, where next day we had a favored meeting with Friends;
after which, went to Gisborough and took lodgings at the house of our friend Ann Coning,
an acceptable minister.
Here, on sixth day, the 7th, we had a meeting in the morning with Friends,
which was a tendering time, and in the evening another with the town`'s-people,
which proved a very solid satisfactory meeting.

8th. Went early to Ayton, and had a meeting there, commencing at nine in the morning,
in which many things were pretty fully opened,
and strength was given to declare the Truth amongst them.
After this meeting we had a solid time with a sick friend,
and in a social way stepped into several Friends`' houses.
Here we parted with dear Ann Coning, who had attended the last three meetings with us,
and was truly helpful to us.
This afternoon we travelled to Stockton, in the county of Durham,
and lodged at Margaret Atkinson`'s, who is a minister.

First day, 9th. Attended Friends`' Meeting here in the morning,
in which I had some searching labor and a serious call to
some who had been visited in a remarkable manner,
but had not been faithful thereto.
In the evening we had a very large public meeting,
in which the dispensations of the Law and the Gospel were exhibited and clearly distinguished,
the power and efficacy of the latter enforced,
and all invited to Him by whom grace and truth cometh.
It was a most solemn time,
in which strength was mercifully given to do the Master`'s will,
and I felt abundant cause to be thankful to Him by whose power alone the
Gospel can be preached effectually and to his honor.

10th. Had a small meeting at Norton at the ninth hour,
and then travelled twenty-five miles to Sunderland, and attended their Select Meeting,
for Newcastle Monthly Meeting, the same evening.
11th. Attended the Monthly Meeting held here, which was comfortable,
and the service fell mostly to my lot, although there were many ministers present.
In the evening, the Select Quarterly Meeting was held,
and next day the Quarterly Meeting for the county of Durham,
in which I was silent throughout.
On fifth day went to the city of Durham, and had a small meeting there;
then returned again to Sunderland, and had a large public meeting in the evening,
to the great relief of my mind.

Here I lodged at Solomon Chapman`'s, a minister in good standing.
Here also lives one Elizabeth Robson, a widow, and valuable minister,
with whom I felt much near unity, and she also gave me the right hand of fellowship,
and offered much encouragement in an interview I
had with her at the close of this last meeting there,
so that my drooping mind was much refreshed and strengthened
by her sweet and sisterly sympathy.
Next day went to Shields,
and had a meeting with Friends to good satisfaction--dined with William Richardson,
whose wife is also an acceptable minister,
and lodged at Robert Spencer`'s. Next morning went to Newcastle,
and took lodgings at Margaret Braggs, where I rested and wrote to my wife and children.

First day, 16th. Attended meeting in the morning, which was a favored time;
and in the evening a very crowded unsettled meeting with the town`'s-people,
and not much openness to revive the Gospel of Christ,
yet I hoped our labors were not wholly lost.
Margaret Bragg is the daughter of Rachel Wilson, an eminent minister,
who once travelled in America in the service of the Gospel; and this, her daughter,
is also a minister in good esteem.

17th. Travelled thirty-four miles to Staindrop,
and had a favored meeting there at five o`'clock; after which,
went home with George Hall and lodged, and next day travelled to Cotherstone,
and had a small meeting there,
and rather an awakening one to some who it was apprehended
had lost ground in their experience.
After this meeting went twenty miles to Darlington,
and lodged at John and Catharine Backhouse`'s, both ministers and very kind friends.

Had a meeting here to good satisfaction,
and next day John and Catharine took us in their carriage to Borrowby,
where we had a very small meeting,
in which both of them bore acceptable testimonies to the Truth;
some labor also fell to my lot and the meeting was satisfactory; after it,
in a Friend`'s house, we had a solid parting opportunity, in which dear C. B.,
in a weighty manner,
put up a petition for my preservation and that of my dear wife and family,
craving that we might be favored to meet again in a mansion of rest.

After parting with them, we went to Thirsk,
and had a meeting there at six o`'clock--long silent and painful,
in which it was felt and apprehended that some, at least,
were laboring under sad infirmities, and knew it not,
so that there was not an applying to the true Physician for help.
At length way opened a little for labor, which, by a careful stepping,
was extended from less to more, and it became a searching time.
From this place we went to Helmsly, and had a meeting there at eleven, and at four,
another at Bilsdale, and on the next day, 22nd, at Hutton, in the Hole, at ten,
and at Kirby Moorside, at two, all open, and some rather awakening times.

At the latter place reside Thomas and Mary Hartas;
she a minister to whom I felt nearly united.
Whilst in this neighborhood, and attending the four last-named meetings,
our lodgings were at the house of Robert Bainbridge, at Helmsly.
Hutton was the last place of residence of John Richardson,
and the same meetinghouse in which he attended is now standing, and yet in use,
though poor.

After these meetings we set out for York, where we arrived late in the evening,
and took lodgings at the house of our dear friend Mary Backhouse.
First day, 23rd. Attended their fore and afternoon meetings; I was silent in the last.
On second day morning my valuable and much beloved friend, George Crosfield,
left me and took stage for Liverpool being under the necessity of returning home.
His company has been truly grateful to me,
and his assistance very useful in promoting my services in this land,
which indeed made me loth to part with him.

On the same day I visited several sick persons; also again my dear friend Hannah Murray,
my countrywoman, with her companion, Hannah Richardson; and on third day,
had meetings at Thornton and Huby, both pretty open times.
Thornton is a meeting which Robert and Sarah Grubb attended for several years,
and is eight miles north of York.
26th. Went to Cottingwith, and had a laborious meeting there, and thence to Selby,
and had an evening meeting to good satisfaction.
27th. Went to Thorn, and met with Mary Fell, from Uxbridge, near London,
with whom I had once met before at Ackworth.
I found that both our appointments here were sent forward for the same time,
so we willingly joined and labored together in unity and true harmony.

Martha Thornhill, from Ackworth,
was also with her and took an acceptable part in the labor.
William Proctor was our guide from Selby to this place,
where we dined at Mordecai Cassons, whose son went as our guide to Cave.
David Priestman, of York, being now my companion, we set out,
and arrived at Cave rather late in the evening,
having had a ferry over the Humber to pass after dark.
28th. Had a public meeting at North Cave,
in which the spirit and power of the Christian religion
was livingly felt and largely spoken of,
and through favor,
tongue and utterance were given to speak to the people of
its superior excellency where its dominion prevails within.

From here we went to Hull, a large commercial town on the Humber,
where I met with my dear friend and countryman, Christopher Healy,
now also here in the service of the Gospel; and we were mutually glad to see each other,
and at our dear friend John and Mabel Hipsley`'s,
we spent the night and most of the next day together, when he left for York,
and I remained here till the day following, which was the first of the week,
and attended their meetings here, both solid and satisfactory.
On first day evening we went home with Thomas and Esther Priestman,
she the daughter of Henry Tuke, of York, and Mabel Hipsley, his sister.
On second day had a meeting at Oustwick, open and satisfactory,
and returned at evening to Hull, and lodged at Isabel Casson`'s, a minister,
now from home, but her daughter Hannah treated us with great kindness.

11th mo., 1st. Returned to York,
and went to my former lodgings with my friend M. Backhouse.
Her son, James Backhouse,
had now gone on an extensive visit to Van Dieman`'s Land and New Holland,
on religious service.
2nd. I attended their mid-week meeting at York, which was a good open time,
and seemed somewhat like finishing my visit here.
After meeting, I had an opportunity with the scholars in the girl`'s school here.
3rd. Went to Ackworth, and lodged at the school; and on sixth day, to Barnsley,
and had a meeting there to pretty good satisfaction; returned again to Ackworth,
and on seventh day, visited the schools.

On first day morning, attended meeting at Ackworth, and afternoon, at Pontefract,
both pretty open; and in the evening,
attended the reading meeting of the scholars at Ackworth, which was a solid time,
and closed with a sweet supplication by Priscilla Kinney, the chief governess.
On second day we again visited the girl`'s school and some individuals in the neighborhood.
This is a very interesting institution, and managed, I believe,
under much of the right authority, and hence of great benefit to the society.
The superintendents, Robert and Hannah Whitaker,
appear to be well qualified for their station in this institution,
being happily endowed with Christian meekness, cheerfulness, and love, which,
with patience and firmness, seems to fit them in a peculiar manner for government.
They are indeed valuable Friends, and were brought very near to my best feelings,
and so also were dear Priscilla Kinney, the governess, and Martha Thornhill,
living at the bottom of the garden--both ministers.

Feeling now clear of Ackworth, we left it on third day morning, the 8th of 11th month,
and went to Wakefield, and had a meeting there, and at six in the evening, at Dewsbury.
On fourth day was at Brighouse in the morning, at Huddersfield in the evening,
and on fifth day, at Halifax--these were generally pretty open meetings,
and I hope some of them profitable.
From Halifax I went to Bradford, to the house of my beloved friend Sarah Harris.
On sixth day had an appointed meeting, long silent, but at length there was given me,
perhaps, as great a fulness of strength as I have often experienced,
and all that was in me praised the Giver.

In the evening, had a meeting at Rawden, which was long painful,
but a little strength was finally given to relieve my mind.
Sarah Harris, Benjamin Seebohm, and Esther, his wife, went with me to this meeting;
they are all ministers.
S+++.+++ H. and E. S. both spoke in this meeting to my satisfaction.
On seventh day, 12th, in company with B. S. and S. H., (David Priestman,
my late companion, having returned home,) went to Gildersome,
where Robert Walker formerly lived, and had a meeting with the few Friends there,
and I was here met by my beloved friend Mary Cooper, of Brighouse.

My spirits being much depressed by the information received
of the death of my dear friend Jonathan Taylor,
of Mount Pleasant, Ohio, (lately deceased at the house of dear Mary J. Lecky, at Kilnock,
in Ireland,) I felt disqualified to labor much in the ministry at this time;
but my friends who were with me were acceptably engaged.
Added to the foregoing event,
an account of the sickness of my dear friend and countryman, Christopher Healy,
now at Thirsk, in this county,
seemed to be an accumulation of affliction and discouragement sufficient
to dishearten a lonely traveller in a foreign land.
On this account, or for some other cause,
I was wholly silent on first day morning at Leeds.
At this time the remains of Catherine Elam were interred.
In the afternoon meeting my mouth was opened upon the subject of humility,
and I alluded to our Saviour`'s parable of the Pharisee and the Publican.

On second day, the 14th, I rested and wrote to America,
and at evening had a meeting with the town`'s-people, much favored;
and the power of Truth, I thought, was in a good degree exalted,
in which many were enabled to rejoice.
My friend Mary Cooper till now remained with me, and was truly helpful.
My dear friend Richard Thompson, from Rawden, met me here,
in order to bear me company for a time on this journey; and on third day, the 15th,
we set out together and went to Birstwick, and had a meeting there towards evening,
in which I trust no dishonor was brought to the Truth.

Fourth day, 16th. We went to Addingham and had a meeting there,
and in the evening another at Skipton.

[.letter-heading]
From Frances Thompson to John Wilbur.

[.signed-section-context-open]
Liverpool, 11th mo., 16th, 1831.

[.salutation]
Dear Friend John Wilbur,

I had given proof of my remembrance of thee,
by rather a long attempt at writing to thee yesterday--but
thy message coming in the evening,
I concluded to begin afresh,
feeling a little additionally encouraged by the intimation
of a wish to have a few lines from me.
I believe thou may give some of us hereaway credit for speaking the truth,
when we say we are deeply interested in thy comfort and welfare every way;
and very encouraging it is to me, in regard to thee, when I retrace thy steps,
and reflect how thou hast been led along,
from the time of thy first coming amongst us;--how, in the first instance,
thou wast brought down out of everything in which the flesh could glory,
and in that state made willing to wait the Master`'s time,
even though it should be to the "`compassing the city seven
days;`"--when I consider how thou wast preserved,
in this time of trial,
from kindling a fire of thy own and warming thyself with the sparks,
and how thou wast kept in patient dependence upon the delivering
Arm until a way was made for thee--I think there is cause for us
to magnify the name of Him who has dealt so bountifully with thee!--who,
from time to time,
(after having brought thee through the deeps,) has
raised thee up to bear testimony to his goodness,
and enabled thee to exalt the standard of Truth and Righteousness, to his praise,
and much, very much, to the satisfaction of thy friends.

I am induced to tell thee this, dear friend, for thy encouragement,
for I recollect that even the Apostle Paul prayed, or desired that others should pray,
that his service might be acceptable to the Church.--Yes, it must be consoling to a poor,
tried pilgrim, to have this seal superadded; therefore,
since thou art so favored of the Master, by thy fellow-laborers, and the church at large,
let me entreat thee to take courage,
to hold up thy head in hope,--that He who has dealt thus bountifully,
will care for thee still; He who has most assuredly put thee forth, will go before thee,
and cover thy head in every battle:--therefore trust in Him, with all thine heart,
and give not way to fears, which should be withstood as they arise.

As to the translation of dear Jonathan Taylor, it is indeed,
in reference to his family and near friends, both here and at home,
a truly affecting circumstance, and particularly so, doubtless, to thyself, and C. Healy,
and S. Grellet--but the balm is still in Gilead, the Physician is still there--therefore,
think not of "`discouragements,`" far less, of "`fainting by the way.`"

In a feeling of much love and sympathy with thee, dear friend, I remain

[.signed-section-closing]
Thy sincere friend,

[.signed-section-signature]
Frances Thompson.

17th. In the morning we were at Airton,
and in the evening at Settle;--these four meetings, though small,
were open and interesting,
and seemed like a renewed visitation to those little companies.
At Settle we lodged at the house of our friend John Tatham, who took us, next morning,
in a post-chaise, to Bentham,
where we had an overshadowing season with Friends and others.
Exhortation and encouragement flowed like a river to a precious little number present;
great indeed were our feelings of joy, and my soul was humbly thankful for the favor.
We returned to Settle the same evening,
and next morning (19th) went to Richard Wilson`'s, whose wife, Deborah Wilson,
is a living gospel minister, with whom I did unite in true fellowship.
We had a little meeting with Friends here, four in number, and one or two others,
in which the language of gospel fellowship flowed like a stream towards them,
in the bonds of that covenant of life and peace of which Christ Jesus is the Mediator;
and living intercessions were lifted up for all those
who are running at the Lord`'s command,
and for dear relatives and friends at home.
After this precious opportunity, we went to Lothersdale,
and lodged at Slater Stansfield`'s.

First day, 20th. We had a meeting with Friends and others,
in which divine power and ability was mercifully given,
to explain and enforce the doctrine that of ourselves
we can do nothing towards our salvation,
but through God`'s grace and the word of his power we can do all things required of us,
in order for that glorious object.
Deborah Wilson came here to meet with us again, and added a short,
lively testimony to the truth.

Second day morning, 21st of 11th month, we left Lothersdale,
and went to Marsden in Lancashire, where I had been once before,
when no way opened for public labor; but now feeling an inclination for another meeting,
it was easily obtained, and a favored season it proved,
in which the people were recommended to a serious inquiry respecting their standing,
and to a consideration of their great indebtedness
to the divine Giver of many good gifts to them;
and my dear aged friend, James Haworth, a living minister of this place,
was exercised in fervent supplication.

Next day, with our valued friend Henry Ecroyd for our guide,
we went to Newton in Yorkshire, twenty-four miles;
had an evening meeting with the few Friends there,
and lodged at Francis Wills`'s. Next day we went to their mid-week meeting at Wyersdale,
which was a solid time; and after meeting went to Lancaster,
and lodged at the house of my kind friend Ann Crosfield,
who with her daughter Elizabeth were very attentive to us.
Here we attended their mid-week meeting on the 24th, to good satisfaction,
and on the 25th went to Calder Bridge, and had a meeting there,
in which a lively call and invitation was extended to those present,
and I had great peace;
after meeting returned to the house of my dear friend A. C.--she
is the mother of my late companion George Crosfield.

25th. James and Elizabeth Crosfield went with us to Yealand,
and we had a favored meeting there, wherein testimony and supplication flowed freely,
and I believe to the refreshing of many present; dined at Ann Wilson`'s,
who took me in her carriage to Kendal.
I attended their meeting here on first day, rather trying; and on second day,
one at Grayrigg, pretty open.
Third day, 29th, we had a good meeting at Preston Patrick;--at this place, in early days,
lived John Camm and John Audland, and afterwards Thomas Gawthrop,
who visited America in the love of the Gospel,
and on his return was accompanied by John Griffith and my great-grandfather Peter Davis.

On fourth day, we had a meeting at Crook, very small but comfortable.
We were told that Edward Borough lived near this place.
Fifth day, attended their Monthly Meeting at Kendal, and these words presented,
"`My treasure is my trust,
and my heart is with it,`" and in the course of enlargement it was remarked,
that the prince of the power of the air is full of all manner of deceivableness,
and as he cannot rule above, he would fain rule below,
and that he would rather have half a kingdom than none at all;
and inasmuch as he could not, by the instigation of Herod,
destroy the young child`'s life, and thereby frustrate the gospel mission,
he then offered him the kingdoms of this world,
professing his ownership and right to give;
that as his object was to turn our Saviour from a heavenly to an earthly kingdom,
so also he would turn us the children of men; and now, if it suited his purpose best,
would change his ground and disclaim all right to the things which the Lord hath made,
and in order to induce us to lay hold of them with avidity,
would even tell us that the earth is the Lord`'s,
and the fulness thereof,--thus striving, if possible,
to allure our affections and place them fully upon it,
and so to divide our minds and make us the subject of two kingdoms,--in which state,
so long as we remain in it, our striving to promote God`'s kingdom will be in vain.

Sixth day, the 20th of 12th mo., in company with my friend William Wilson,
went to Colthouse, and next day had a meeting there,
and an opening for considerable labor.
Next day went to Ulverston, near Swarthmore,
and on the day following had a meeting in the meetinghouse
built by order and at the expense of George Fox,
on a valuable lot of land which he gave for the purpose.
On a stone over the door was this inscription, "`Exdono G. F. A. D. 1688.`"
In this house we sat in a state of great barrenness for a long time, owing, as I thought,
to too much dependence on formality, without the pure life of religion,
and their hearts comparing more with a house of merchandise than with a house of prayer.
At length way seemed to open, and much labor was bestowed, I trust,
to the solemnizing of divers present;
and I believe some resolutions were adopted for an amendment in the vital principle.
After this labor the spirit of supplication prevailed, and the help of those present,
with the messengers and ministers of Christ, and the church at large in this land,
were fervently interceded for,
and that our Zion might again shine forth and be restored to her ancient beauty.

After this meeting, as we returned to our lodgings,
we stopped a little to see Swarthmore Hall, the residence of Judge Fell,
and afterwards of George Fox, who married his widow, that true handmaid of the Lord,
Margaret Fell; and next day had a pretty satisfactory meeting at Height,
and returned again to Kendal.

Third day morning, the 5th of 12th month, in company with Isaac Wilson,
I set out for Scotland; travelled forty-five miles to Carlisle,
and next morning took the mail-coach to Edinburgh,
where we arrived the same evening and took lodgings
at the house of my dear friend Alexander Cruikshank.
On the 8th, we attended their two months`' meeting, which was an open, satisfactory time.
Next day rested, and wrote to my wife and other friends in America.

Seventh day, 10th. Travelled by coach to Glasgow, forty two miles,
visited three families of Friends that night, and next day all the rest in this place,
and attended both their morning and afternoon meeting.
It was indeed a day of spiritual favor, wherein I trust the truth was set over error,
and the power of an endless life was felt to abound.

Second day, 12th. We took coach for Aberdeen and travelled sixty-six miles to Perth,
and lay by, having been extremely ill since yesterday evening with headache and vomiting,
which was much increased by the motion of the coach,
and continued most of the night following; but next morning, feeling a little better,
proceeded to Aberdeen, and continued to improve through the day.
Took lodgings with my dear friend Jane Cruikshank, a daughter of John Wigham;
and on the following morning called to see her father, a valuable friend,
now in the eighty-fourth year of his age.
He travelled extensively in America near forty years ago, on Truth`'s account.
I well remember seeing him at my father`'s house at that time; myself and wife,
then young and newly-married, received some tender and precious counsel from him,
which has endeared his memory to us ever since,
and made this interview exceedingly interesting to me.
Its occurrence was occasion of deep gratitude;
and truly comfortable was it to witness the precious savor
of heavenly good that appears to rest upon him,
and to season both his company and conversation.
His numerous posterity forms no inconsiderable part of the Society of Friends in Scotland.

On the 14th, had a meeting with the very small number of Friends who reside here,
and was led in language of encouragement to them.
15th. Went by post-chaise to Kilmuck, and had a meeting there.
On this and the following day, made family visits to all the members of this meeting;
I felt great peace in the service.
After which, we returned again to Aberdeen,
and had an evening meeting for the inhabitants of that town, which was an open time,
and the people attentive.
Seventh day, 17th. We took coach and travelled to Edinburgh that night,
a distance of 126 miles, where next day, the first of the week,
we attended their meetings, in which Divine favor was granted, especially in the morning.

Elizabeth Nicholson, from Whitehaven, being about to engage in a family visit here,
was desirous of my company in the service,
and as I had thought much of the families generally in Scotland,
I felt willing to accompany her, at least for a time,
but soon found that such a service here was not for me now,
and so declined going through.
After resting a day or two, and writing to my friends in America,
we left Edinburgh on the 21st,
and went to Hawick and attended their small meeting in the evening,
which was a season of open labor,
and way was made for coming to the feet of Divine mercy.
At this season, my work in Scotland, and the subjects of it, were brought to remembrance,
and prayers ascended to the Almighty that our labors
might be as a nail fastened in a sure place,
and that a renewal of living engagement for the upholding
of the good cause in Scotland might be witnessed.

Now feeling clear of Scotland, and peaceful regarding my labors there,
we set out on the 22nd for England again, and arrived at Carlisle the same evening,
and took lodgings again with my kind friend Thomas Stordy.
This has, indeed, been a fatiguing journey,
partly on account of the great distances travelled,
and partly from my having been several times indisposed in body, which,
with other causes, sometimes brought much discouragement upon me;
but my blessed Lord and Master, whom I had given up to follow, was good and kind to me,
and did not leave nor forsake me entirely; for however low I was at times,
yet in the end I found his hand to be near and underneath to sustain me;
for which unmerited mercy, I feel bound ever to bless and praise his holy name,
and again to resign up all, both soul and body, wife and children, country and friends,
for Christ`'s sake and the Gospel`'s.

On the same evening that I arrived at Carlisle, I attended their Select Meeting,
and on the next day, their Monthly Meeting, to a good degree of satisfaction;
and the following evening, had a meeting at Scotby,
and lodged at the house of my kind friends, Lydia Sutton and Tabitha Irwin.
With these friends next day I rested, and was refreshed with their company.

First day,
25th. I attended their morning and afternoon meeting
again at Carlisle--the labor being close and arduous.
The latter was also attended by my friend Lydia Sutton,
who came here this afternoon to accompany me to a few meetings,
and next day we went to Kirklington,
where Solport Friends also met us,--and a searching time ensued.

Third day, 27th. Had a precious favored meeting at Moorhouse,
L+++.+++ S. adding her testimony for the Truth.
After this, we went to Wigton, and stayed at the house of our friend Robert Dodgson;
next day, visited the school there for Friends`' of Cumberland and Scotland,
consisting of thirty of each sex.
In the evening, attended the Select Quarterly Meeting, which was small,
and the members were reminded of their responsibility.
Fifth day, 29th. I attended the Quarterly Meeting,
where it was my lot to blow the trumpet,
and call the solemn assembly to gather home to the Lord their tent and tabernacle.
After meeting, my friend Lydia Sutton returned home,
and Thomas Stordy gave up to be my companion for a time.

Sixth day, 30th. We attended meeting at Beckfoot, and in the evening at Allonby,
in both of which I had much open searching labor.
In the first, the passage "`Repent,
for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,`" and in the last "`Thou shalt not withhold from
the Lord thy sacrifices,`" were severally introduced as they arose without premeditation,
and led to much doctrine and exhortation.
We lodged at Allonby, at the house of Thomas Dickenson and sisters,
and next day had a good meeting at Maryport;
then went to Whitehaven and put up at James Nicholson`'s, and here,
on the first day of the 1st mo., first of the week 1832,
we attended their fore and afternoon meetings.
In the morning,
the experimental knowledge of God through Christ Jesus was opened and enlarged upon,
and in the evening near the close, the excellency of silent worship.
And after meeting at a Friend`'s house, I fell in with two young ministers,
to whom some solid counsel flowed freely, and I found peace.

On the 2nd day, we went to Greysouthen,
and had an open meeting there with Friends and others;
on the following day to Pardshaw Hall, where we had a meeting to good satisfaction,
and in the evening, one at Broughton, where, although much labor was extended, and,
I think, under the right direction,
yet so much satisfaction as in the morning was not felt.
This is the place where John Hall lived.
He was once in America on religious service,
and I saw divers of his children hereaway who are valuable Friends.

Next day, went to Cockermouth, and had a very open meeting there;
the subject treated on was principally the necessity
and excellence of humility and Christian meekness.
We dined here at Deborah Robinson`'s, and afterwards went to Gilfoot,
and lodged at Joseph Priestman`'s, where, next day,
we had a little meeting to a degree of satisfaction.
Thomas Stordy, having resigned his place as my companion to James Nicholson,
we went to Mosedale, near which, next day, the 6th,
had a good meeting with a few Friends and a number of others,
in which I was led to treat on the subjects of purification, Divine worship,
and the qualification of a Gospel minister.
From Mosedale we went to Penrith, and first month, 7th, we travelled to Aldston, where,
next day, we had a meeting with the very few Friends there, and a number of others,
mostly Methodists, who appeared to be very destitute of vital Christianity,
and I found it to be very difficult to make any impression upon their feelings.

It proved rather a painful time, and required great care in stepping safely along,
as there was felt to be much opposition in the meeting; towards the close, however,
some encouragement went freely to Friends.
After meeting, we went to Allendale, where, next day, the 9th,
we had a solid open meeting with Friends and Methodists,
and I trust it was a time of renewing to divers present.
Then went to Cornwood, and lodged at Thos.
Wigham`'s, where next day, the 10th, we had a favored meeting with Friends, Methodists,
and others,
in which the substance and power of Christianity were exalted above the mere form;
the people were very solid and attentive, and appeared to be glad of the opportunity,
and I trust that many of them were edified.

On fifth day, the 12th, we attended Friends`' Meeting at Penrith,
to a good degree of satisfaction, and in the evening,
had a public meeting with the town`'s-people,--long silent,
but way at length opened to treat on the ministry, humility, and Christianity generally.
This meeting was fully attended, and among others, was one Thompson,
called a Doctor of Divinity.
It was a solid meeting, and ended well.
On sixth day, 13th, (in company with Isaac Wilson and wife, Mary Wilson, a minister,
who also attended the meetings at Penrith,) had a meeting at Terril and Morland,
in which I was favored to feel peace.

Next day, we travelled to Hawes, in Yorkshire, and on first day, the 15th,
had a meeting at Aysgarth, which was interrupted by a man of the Methodist persuasion;
but after giving him some pretty close hints, we had open service,
and the meeting ended satisfactorily.
On second day, the 16th, had meetings both at Counterside and Hawes;
and in the former I was largely opened on the successive
dealings of the Almighty with mankind,
from the fall, down to the present time;
and remarks were made upon the times before the law,
as well as upon the two dispensations of the law and the gospel; inferring that,
as the people under the law seemed prone to revert
to that which prevailed before the law,
to wit, idolatry; so in these gospel days, those whose religion is only literal,
or professional, and standeth not in the life and power,
seem disposed to revert back to the ceremonials and ordinances of the law.

The meeting at Hawes was laborious, and the current of the gospel did not run so freely.
At Counterside, we lodged at the house of William Fothergill,
grandson of John Fothergill;
the latter a valuable minister who once travelled in America.
On third day, 17th, we proceeded to Dent, and had a good open meeting there,
but were apprehensive that the people were too much like
Israel in Egypt,--easy under the hand of the oppressor.
Next day, went to Narthwaite, and sat with the few Friends there, silent for a long time,
until at length my dear friend, Mary Wilson, spoke a few words,
which seemed to open the way for me also to subjoin a little,
and the meeting ended satisfactorily.

On fifth day, 19th, we went to Grisedale, and had a good meeting there,
M+++.+++ W. having also a short, lively testimony; and on sixth day,
had a meeting at Brigflats, near to Sedbergh;--long gathering, long silent;
but way at length opened for some lively, close service among them.
At Sedbergh, we saw the Yewtrees, which are yet standing,
under which George Fox had a meeting in 1652.
One of these trees was dead and dry, but the other has yet a few green branches about it.
This place was also the residence of Samuel Bownas.
The meetinghouse at Brigflats was built, as appears by the date over the door, in 1675,
and the little place over the gallery, where Samuel Bownas sat when reproved,
in a public manner, by Anne Wilson, still remains.^
footnote:[Of this incident, Samuel Bownas thus speaks in his [.book-title]#Life# (Friends`' Library,
Philadelphia, vol.
iii. p.8.) "`One first day, being at meeting a young woman, named Anne Wilson,
was there and preached.
She was very zealous, and I fixing my eye upon her, she, with a great zeal,
pointed her finger at me, uttering these words with much power:
'`A traditional Quaker! thou comest to meeting as thou went from it the last time,
and goest from it as thou came to it, but art no better for thy coming;
what wilt though do in the end?`' This was so suited to my condition, that, like Saul,
I was smitten to the ground; but, turning my thoughts inward, in secret I cried: '`Lord,
what shall I do to help it?`' And a voice, as it were, spoke in my heart,
saying '`Look unto me, and I will help thee;`' and I found much comfort`" etc.
To this singular and striking reproof,
S+++.+++ Bownas attributes his awakening from his previous state of levity and lukewarmness,
to a change of life.]
On seventh day, the 21st of 1st mo., went home with L and M. Wilson to Kendal.
When at this place before, I had a little glimpse of visiting Friends`' families here,
and, while absent, the prospect had increased from time to time; and now, on arriving,
the concern came weightily before me.

Next day, the first of the week, attended their morning meeting,
but no way opened for public labor;
and being now confirmed that if I did not give up to visit the families,
no way would open for service here, or to leave the place with peace of mind,
after meeting I laid my concern before some of the ministers and elders,
and obtained their concurrence; and, on the same evening,
in company with my aforesaid friend, Mary Wilson, who felt an engagement to join me,
I proceeded on the service which was completed on sixth day following,
there being sixty-four families of Friends,
and several others who were in the practice of attending Friends`' meetings.

This proved an exercising work, and some very trying cases occurred,
in which close doctrine was administered, and in some others,
where easy work was expected, it seemed difficult to get forward,
my mind being exceedingly closed up;
but there were a few instances where the gospel current flowed like oil,
to our comfort and refreshment.
Whilst on this family visit, my friend and countryman, Christopher Healy, came to Kendal,
and stayed with me two nights.
Not feeling easy now to leave this place without another meeting with Friends,
I concluded to stay until first day, and, in their morning meeting, had much labor,
though not very relieving;
but finding a concern on my mind for a meeting with the inhabitants of Kendal,
it was appointed to be held at six o`'clock in the evening, and a very quiet,
solid meeting it was, and power was manifestly given to preach the gospel,
in the demonstration of the Spirit, and I felt to praise the Lord, our only helper,
with great thankfulness of heart.

My Dear Friend,

Having this opportunity, I wish to send thee a few lines of remembrance,
though my mind seems full only of poverty and a great lack of good,
yet it may serve to assure thee how much we feel bound to thee in strong affection,
and that which makes it pleasant frequently to hear from thee,
and of thy being favored to proceed in thy labor with comfortable
feelings and increased strength for thy day`'s work;
this I pray for, and believe it will be continued to thee to the end,
and doubt not thou wilt be permitted to feel at last the reward of thy dedication,
and as one, who, having accomplished the appointed labor,
can enjoy the sweet feeling of rest, and the wages of contentment and peace.

I often recur to that portion of thy travels in which I was favored to accompany thee,
and partake of seasons of refreshment along with thee;
such a period of abstraction from the many absorbing
cares of the situation in which I am placed,
I felt then, and still feel to be very salutary and strengthening,
but which I am seldom permitted to partake of; if I could,
I am very sensible it would greatly tend to my growth in good,
which amidst all I do at times earnestly crave for and seek after.

There is abundant need, in the present state of our Society, for its members to seek,
individually, to witness a growth and establishment in the Truth,
that so they may be enabled faithfully to uphold and support its testimonies,
which are in many places, cast down and almost trodden under foot;
but it is cause of thankfulness that some are called,
and going about to help and strengthen, in their allotments,
those who are concerned on these accounts;
and if there should not be much apparent fruit from
the labors of such immediately to be discerned,
yet it should not minister discouragement, for we may hope that the fruit will appear,
even though it may be after many days.

It was very pleasant to see Christopher Healy at Liverpool again;
he made but a short stay with us;
but the innocent cheerfulness and peaceful feeling which seemed to clothe his spirit,
gave evidence of his having been engaged to the satisfaction and relief of his mind.

[.signed-section-closing]
I remain thy very affectionate friend,

On second day morning, the 30th, with I. W. still for my companion, I went to Settle,
and on third day, to Bradford, and lodged at John Hustler`'s, at Undercliff.
There, next day, attended their mid-week meeting, and afterwards went to Foot-Hill,
and next day, to Wooldale, to their mid-week meeting,
and from thence to the meeting at High-Flatts.
These three meetings were pretty open, especially the last, which was truly a solid time.
After this, we went to Sheffield, and lodged at William Hargreaves, who himself was gone,
with Stephen Grellet, to Birmingham, but his children were very kind to us.

On seventh day, in company with dear Lydia Hargreaves and Charlotte Tomkinson,
went to Woodhouse, and had a meeting with a few Friends and many others,
which was favored, and next day, the 1st of the week, and 5th of the 2nd mo.,
we attended their morning meeting at Sheffield, and, in the evening,
had a public meeting there, very large,
(supposed to be near a thousand people present,) quiet and solid,
and strength was admirably given to exalt the power of Christianity over
all the forms and ceremonies practised among the professors of it;
and my heart was filled with praise and thanksgiving to God for his unspeakable gifts.

Sheffield, 2nd mo., 6,1832.

[.salutation]
My Dear Wife,

On my arrival at Kendal,
where I have been for some time past engaged in visiting families,
I received thy letter of the 1st of 12th mo.,
and was greatly comforted in hearing thereby that you were all well;
and to be remembered by so many of my relations and friends, was also cause of gratitude,
and I desire in return to be remembered to them.
We attended their meeting here yesterday morning,
and last evening one for the town`'s-people, which was very large,
nearly a thousand people were thought to be collected, and it was an interesting meeting.
We are about to leave here this afternoon on our way to London,
taking meetings as we go--think of visiting the Capital
and the adjacent meetings some time before the Yearly Meeting,
so as not to be there when they are engaged in preparing for that event.

I have, since coming here, received a kind letter from my dear friend George Crosfield,
proposing to join me again in a few weeks as my companion.
I feel truly desirous that my being absent from you may be no discouragement
or hindrance to the well-doing of my dear children,
but that they would remember that my mind is much with them;
and that I have longing desires to see them that I might impart some strength and encouragement
to them in walking in the fear of the Lord and in the ways of wisdom;
and hope they will constantly cherish feelings of love and kindness towards one another,
and towards their dear mother, for this is the very consummation of all social enjoyment,
and leads directly to that of the love of God which, indeed, of all enjoyments,
is the most precious.
That this may be yours,
is of all things the greatest desire that I can have for thee my best earthly beloved,
and for the pledges of God`'s goodness to us, our dear children;
and may the blessing of Heaven above, and of all that is good beneath,
rest upon you and keep you in the bond and covenant of peace and love.

We stayed at Sheffield until second day afternoon, and then went to Chesterfield,
where next day I had a time of close labor in their meeting,
and was apprehensive that too many of them were in an easy, lukewarm state,
but had a little refreshing opportunity with a few Friends after dinner,
and then went to Mansfield, and had a meeting there, and great peace ensued.

After meeting, at Mansfield, we visited a charitable institution,
it being a comfortable accommodation (made by a friendly
female who died in 1693) for six females,
widows or single women, destitute of means of their own,
and members of the Society of Friends, with a room, closet, etc., for each,
on the ground floor,
and money enough to supply them comfortably with all the necessaries of life.
We had religious opportunities with all of these, save one,
and they appeared very comfortable, and mostly thankful for this outward provision,
as well as for our visit.

Went the same evening to Heanor, and next morning, at Breach, with Friends and others,
in which the doctrines of the Lord`'s Supper, baptism, the ministry, prayer and singing,
were severally treated on, and very extensive were my labors this day.
Was afterwards informed that two "`Clergymen`" and a number of their hearers were present.
At three o`'clock this afternoon we had another meeting at Furnace, long silent,
as I thought, on account of the expectation of those present, being so very much outward;
but, at length, by a short testimony,
I believe a solid covering was brought over the meeting,
and I hoped our labors here were not entirely lost.

After this we travelled late in the evening, and got to Bakewell, and next day, the 10th,
had a good meeting at Monyash, in which, I trust,
many minds were renewed and strengthened,
and we much comforted in the extension of the Lord`'s mercy to us;
and the meeting was concluded with solemn supplication.
On seventh day, 11th, travelled thirty miles to Derby, where, next day,
the first of the week, we sat with Friends in the morning.
In the evening we had a very crowded public meeting,
insomuch that all the aisles were filled with people standing; nevertheless,
when the meeting was fully gathered, it soon became very quiet and solid,
and help and strength were graciously given, to preach the gospel among them,
and to insist upon the necessity of knowing the vital principle and power of religion,
every one for himself and within himself; and way was made for living supplication,
and the house of prayer was made to us exceedingly joyful.

On second day we went to Castle Donington, and had an open, favored meeting there,
and after it, went to Nottingham, where next day we had a favored meeting with Friends,
in which my testimony was of a very peculiar character.
I had to speak of some uncommon affliction and trouble
which I believed was attending some in that meeting;
and also of the admirable mercy and kindness of the Lord, in plucking some,
as it were from the hand of the enemy, who, I verily believed,
was lurking about the camp, in order to carry away captive some of the Lord`'s people,
etc.

After leaving here, we were informed that a married man, a stranger,
had stolen the affections of a precious young woman, a member of that meeting,
and had taken her from her father`'s house privately, in the evening,
put her into a postchaise, and made off with her; but she, being soon missed,
her brother and another young man pursued them with great speed, and,
after travelling about twenty miles, overtook them, drove rapidly by,
and wheeling short about before them, brought them to a stand;
then going immediately to the chaise door, suddenly pulled out the man first,
and then the young woman,
who protested strongly against going home--but home she was carried,
and soon became very penitent,
and was made to rejoice at her own preservation and escape.
She was that day at our meeting, and greatly tendered; and dined with us after meeting,
in great brokenness of spirit,
but we knew nothing of the affair until after we left the place.

In the afternoon we went to Loughborough, and lodged at Francis Cumins`'s, where,
on the 15th, we sat with his family in the meetinghouse,
they being all the members of our Society in this place.
The opportunity was not very lively, but some counsel was offered and peace ensued.
After this we travelled to Leicester, and on the 16th, attended their Monthly Meeting,
which was a solid, awakening time; visited a sick friend, and after meeting,
went to Ullsthorpe, thirteen miles, and next day, attended their meeting at Hinkley;
very small, but I had a short lively testimony for them.
Then went to Atherstone, where we supposed a meeting was appointed for us,
but found the information had failed,
so we went on to Tamworth and lodged at Ann Fowler`'s, at Aldermills, in Staffordshire.

It appears that several meetings in these parts have been discontinued,
and those which remain are very small, which is a consideration truly mournful,
as it must have been occasioned by unfaithfulness.
This day, the 17th, we passed near the birthplace of that worthy Elder, George Fox,
which was at Drayton, near Harts-Hill.
At Tamworth, on the 18th, we had a meeting, consisting of four females only,
to whom the gospel, in the love of it, seemed to flow sweetly,
and an invitation was feelingly extended to a young woman present,
who was gay and dressy, but not beyond hope.

From this place we went to Birmingham, where next day, the first of the week,
we attended their fore and afternoon meetings; the first long silent,
but afterward a state of departure from the Truth, as well as other things,
was spoken to, and I was glad I waited for the right opening.
That in the afternoon was open and solid.
This afternoon I took tea with Richard Cadbury, where nearly thirty Friends came in,
with whom we had a good opportunity; and afterwards called to see a young widow,
whose husband and brother were both drowned on the north coast of Wales,
about the time I passed there when I was first about to land in England.
This young woman had with her a brother and sister, and her husband`'s brother and sister.
She and her sister were in great affliction,
and we had a very tendering opportunity with them.

On second day afternoon, went to Coventry, where, next day, we had a meeting,
and thence to Northampton, where we attended Friends`' mid-week meeting,
which was satisfactory, and in the evening, had a public meeting; hard and trying.
The minds of the people were so much outward, and insensible of religious impressions,
that it was difficult to find an entrance,
but still we had a hope that some good might have been done.
Next day, the 24th, went to Kettering, and had a precious meeting there,
and in the afternoon, another such at Wellingborough,
and Friends from Finedon also met with us here.

Next day, went to Raunds and had a meeting, to which came three Methodist preachers,
some of their hearers, and a few Friends, to whose different states, I trust,
suitable instruction was given.
After this meeting we proceeded to Olney,
(the residence of Cowper,) where we had a little comfortable meeting in the morning,
and at four p.m. another at Hogsty-End, to good satisfaction.
Thence we went to Woburn, and next day to Leighton,
where my ministerial labors were rather heavy, but by stepping carefully,
they became close and searching.

After this we went to Luton, and next day had a meeting there,
where the gospel flowed freely in a living call to their tents,
to their watchtower and place of safety.
After this meeting,
went to Ampthill and lodged at our kind friends`' Samuel and Ann May`'s, where, next day,
we had a meeting with Friends of that place, and those of Cranfield; a laborious meeting.
We went from Ampthill to Hitchin, and next day, the first of 3rd mo.,
attended their week-day meeting,
at which the marriage of the granddaughter of Thomas Shillitoe was accomplished.
Here we also met with this venerable and worthy old man.
I was truly glad to see him, and his company was very savory and acceptable.

On sixth day, the 2nd, had a meeting in the morning at Baldock, good and comfortable,
and at two o`'clock at Ashwell--things very low, and a lively alarm sounded.
At six in the evening had a meeting at Royston,
which was highly favored both in testimony and supplication.
These three meetings were all small, and things, to outward appearance,
in regard to a succession, very discouraging,
yet I felt great peace in this day`'s labor.
Next day we went to Ware, and the day following, first of the week,
we had a meeting with Ware and Hertford Friends together, at Hertford,
where pride and high-mindedness, a primary cause of missing, were spoken of,
and contrasted with meekness and humility, the true characteristics of Christianity.

In the afternoon, had a meeting with Friends at Hoddesdon, long, dull, and dry,
very little life to be felt, but after long silence, through some honest labor,
I obtained a degree of relief.
We here lodged at James Manser`'s, who, with his wife, went with us to Stanstead,
where we had a painful meeting on account, as I believed,
of great unfaithfulness in some.
We lodged here at Isabel Graver`'s, a widow of fourscore and four years,
but lively in her mind, and very kind to us.
On third day we went to Dunmow, where we had a good, lively meeting,
and in the afternoon another at Stebbing, being joined also by Friends of Felstead,
and it proved a solid meeting.
On fourth day, at Bardfield, had a painful and distressing meeting.

After meeting, a friend living within a few yards from the meetinghouse,
desired me to call at his house to see his son, who, he said, was not at meeting,
and concluding he was unwell, I went; but when I asked him how he did,
he replied that he was well,
and his father remarked that he was left in care of the shop;
by which account I was much grieved,
and observed to the parents that I had given up all
my time and business for a long season,
and moreover, had forsaken all my near and dear connections,
to visit Friends in this country;
and now I felt distressed that any one living so near should
think of suffering the trivial concerns of business to prevent
themselves or their families from coming to the meeting.
And by what I could find, it appeared that there were several in this place who were,
in like manner, at home; and I have been afflicted at divers places in this land,
on this account.

At Saffron-Walden, on the 8th, we had a solid, favored meeting, after which,
we paid four family visits in a religious way, before dinner.
From this place we went to Haverhill, in Suffolk, where, next day,
we had a meeting to pretty good satisfaction, and after it, went to Halstead,
where on the following day, we had a solid meeting in the morning, and in the afternoon,
another such at Colne, and the same evening went to Coggeshall, where, next day,
the 11th and first of the week, we were at meeting in the morning,
and the Friends of two other meetings in the neighborhood were invited,
and mostly attended.
This was a favored meeting.
On the same day we went to Colchester, and attended their afternoon meeting,
to which also divers others came of their own accord.

But here it was the Lord`'s will that an outward expectation, which too much prevailed,
should be disappointed; for a word was not uttered in it.
Here we lodged at the house of a physician, whose wife is a gay woman;
to whom a loving invitation was extended in the morning before we left,
which was acceptable to him, if not to her.
On second day morning, on our way,
we called to see a dear Friend by the name of Emma Elizabeth Woodward,
who went with us to Layer-Breton, where we had a refreshing time, and some present were,
I believe, comforted, she appearing very acceptably in supplication.

We returned to Coggeshall this afternoon, where I met with our dear aged friend,
William Hickman, yet alive, and green in his old age,
being now in his eighty-seventh year.
This evening at five, we attended the Select Quarterly Meeting for Essex,
in which it was my lot to labor, and I found peace.
Next day, the 13th, attended their Quarterly Meeting,
which was pretty good in the forepart, but grew painful to me toward the close.
There was seen a disposition in some, who were not enough baptized themselves,
to meddle with things which belonged not to them,
and to call others to account who were much better than they.
These forward spirits demanded the answers to the queries from
the Select Meeting and had them read in the meeting at large.

I left this meeting deeply pained, and passed the following night in great affliction;
but next morning, at Witham, my tongue was loosed,
and way being made for testimony and supplication,
I found the truth of that saying that "`Sorrow may endure for a night,
but joy cometh in the morning.`"
Afternoon, at Maldon, we had an open meeting, and took tea at Robert and Phebe Alsop`'s,
with whom I felt good unity, and in them found affectionate, sympathizing friends.
They attended five or six meetings with me.
On fourth day evening, the 14th, we went to Chelmsford, and on the 15th,
had a meeting with Friends there in the morning;
where my testimony related to the fall of man, and the loss of the Divine image.

The introduction of that of the wicked one was explained,
and the effect thereof was brought very closely home to the states of some present,
and some, too, who might think themselves very wise; and as afterwards appeared,
it sat very uneasily upon some of this description.
In the evening we had a public meeting, at the close of which,
several solid Friends expressed their satisfaction; and our dear friend, Rebecca Christy,
a minister who sat by me, alluded to the meeting in the morning with much interest,
saying, she left it rejoicing on her way, and weeping as she went.

On the next morning, at the house of our Friend Joseph Marriage, where I lodged,
came a person with a grievous complaint against my ministry there,
especially in the morning,
declaring that meeting to have been the most painful one he ever sat in,
and that he was not alone in this opinion of my ministry.
I said but little to him,
but let him know that I was not at all surprised that my
testimony lay heavy upon some who were in that meeting;
nor yet that there were more than one who were uneasy with it.

Afterwards I came to a full understanding that this man and his
brother-in-law profess to be very knowing about preaching,
and though not Elders in the Society, take much upon them,
in reproving and dictating to the ministers,
and appear to be restless under the testimony of Truth; and, as I believe,
because they cannot bear sound doctrine, being lifted up in their minds;
but as to the meeting in the morning above alluded to,
I have rarely had greater assurance in my own mind, of a right opening,
and a better declaration, in my little experience;
and well knowing that I went to meeting entirely empty-handed and unarmed,
desiring to follow the pure unfolding of the gospel message,
if it should be my lot to preach; I believe, through much favor,
that Jerusalem was that day searched,
and some of the iniquities within her detected and reproved;
but whether those to whom that reproof belonged will hearken to it,
or harden their necks against it, is yet to me unknown.
We went next day to Epping,
and at six in the evening had a comfortable meeting with Friends there.
The children of a boarding-school also came, to whom counsel flowed pretty freely.

Next morning, the 17th, went to Tottenham, and lodged at Thomas Shillitoe`'s,
and on first day, the 18th, attended their meeting in the morning,
and that at Stoke-Newington, in the afternoon, both pretty solid meetings.
To the latter belong William Allen, and John and Sarah Grubb.
This evening we went into London,
guided by our friend Peter Bedford who came here to meet us,
and took us to his house and bade us welcome there as well as in the metropolis.
On second day, the 19th, took a short view of the city, and wrote to America;
and on third day, in the morning, attended Devonshire House mid-week meeting,
and in the afternoon, went twenty-one miles to Hertford,
and attended their Select Quarterly Meeting, the same evening;
in which I offered something by way of encouragement.

Next day, their Quarterly Meeting at large was favored,
and the power of Truth was evidently with us.
Here my kind friend Richard Thompson, who had been about seven weeks with me,
as companion, took leave,
and returned to his home in Yorkshire and I returned back towards London,
and lodged at Mary Stacy`'s, at Tottenham; and next morning, with George Stacy,
went into the city, and attended Westminster Meeting, and in the evening,
had a religious opportunity with Peter Bedford`'s silk-weavers, to some satisfaction.
On sixth day morning, we attended their meeting at Radcliff, silent, and in the evening,
the Peel Meeting, long silent, but way was at length made for some close communication.

On seventh day, I was intending to visit Croydon School,
but was too much unwell to do so,
and have continued somewhat indisposed to the present time, which is the 28th of 3rd mo.
The Quarterly Meeting for London and Middlesex was held yesterday at Devonshire House,
and an adjournment of it today; but I have not been able to attend it,
in which allotment I am satisfied.
In the afternoon I went in William Allen`'s coach, to his house at Newington,
and next morning, the 29th, feeling much better, returned, through London, to Peckham,
where we attended their mid-week meeting,
in which strength was given to do what appeared to be my duty.

My dear friend Samuel May, of Ampthill, having joined me as companion,
also attended this meeting.
On sixth day, 30th, went to Croydon, and had a meeting there,
where Friends of the county of Middlesex,
have a boarding-school of one hundred and fifty scholars, who also attended this meeting,
and I had a comfortable hope that some good was done.

Here we lodged at John Barclay`'s, (a descendant of the Apologist,) an exemplary,
consistent Friend, and minister in good esteem.
Next day went to Wandsworth, and had a meeting there,
in which an alarm was sounded to some who were believed
to be unfaithful to the visitations of Divine Grace;
and I found great peace in this day`'s labor.
Lodged here at the house of our kind friend, John Bell, a minister; and next morning,
being first of the week, and first of the 4th mo., went again to London,
and attended Grace-Church Street meeting, in which I had much close, searching labor,
and therein had peace.
And after meeting, at the house of Cornelius Hanbury, Plough Court, I met,
for the first time in England, with my dear friend, Stephen Grellet,
just arrived in the city, from Uxbridge, much unwell.
He went home with William Allen, to rest and recruit.

This afternoon, we attended their meeting over the bridge,
in that part of the city called Southwark,--nearly silent;
and afterwards went to Peckham, and lodged.
Next day, wrote letters to America, and went to Deptford,
having a meeting at six o`'clock in the evening,
in which I was led to speak of the ministry,--of the times and seasons,
as well as of the immediate quickening of Divine Truth,
as the only qualification for rightfully and profitably preaching the gospel of Christ.
I had no information of there being any one present, who professed such a calling,
but found afterwards, that there was a preacher there, who, it seems,
felt very restless under my testimony; and he opened to me, next morning,
his mind upon the subject, saying,
that he was disposed to think such an one might teach the people properly enough,
without waiting upon God for the influence of his Spirit.

The discovery of such a sentiment as this,
entertained by a professed minister of our Society, was, indeed, a great grief to me.
And I could but see, that if this should become general,
our testimonies concerning worship and the ministry
would be lost and trodden under foot of men;
for if our ministers abandon that patient, reverent, and silent waiting upon God,
for strength and a renewed qualification, as well as for the matter to communicate,
their offerings will certainly be no better than salt which has lost its savor;
and we should soon get into the form, without the power.
Next day, we went to Rochester, and lodged at the house of our dear, aged friend,
William Rickman, and the day after, attended their Monthly Meeting there,
in which I thought the Truth favored us.

The day following, went to Canterbury, and had an evening meeting; thence to Dover,
and had, in the morning, a very solid meeting, and, in the afternoon,
another at Folkestone.
On seventh day, went to Hastings, lodging at Richard P. Rickman`'s, and next day,
attended their little meeting there,
kept up only by a few young Friends who have recently
settled in this place on account of trade.
There I met with Rachel Rickman, a young woman of much stability of mind,
to whom I felt nearly united, in the bonds of gospel fellowship.

She rests, as I trust, upon the true foundation, the Rock of Ages.
And this I was made sensible of, when sitting silently beside her,
both in meeting and out of meeting.
With this little company at Hastings,
we had a precious and highly favored meeting,--the current
of gospel communication and of intercession flowed freely.
I was comforted and refreshed by this feast of fat things,
and my heart was lifted up with thanksgiving to the Lord.
On second day, the 9th, had a meeting at Lewes, dined with John Rickman,
and then went to Brighton, and attended the Select Quarterly Meeting the same evening.

Brighton, 4th mo., 10th, 1832.

[.salutation]
My Beloved Wife,

I have recently been greatly comforted and strengthened
by the receipt of divers letters from thee and the children,
as well as from other dear friends in America; and truly no one can tell,
but by experience,
how good and comfortable it is to get fresh accounts from their
near relations and friends while thus travelling in a distant land,
and meeting with an entire new set of strangers almost every day;
and having to sit down with them where they sit,
which sometimes is not in the most delightful place,
but often brings into much painful exercise, and sometimes, to pretty close dealing;
but when that proves to be needful, I have, in almost all cases,
been favored to do it in a way that tended to gather rather than scatter;
but in two or three instances, what I have delivered, has set so close upon a few,
that they have manifested some restlessness, and have, in two instances,
tried to get me to take it off them; but truly,
their management confirmed me in the belief,
that the garment fitted and set well on them; moreover,
some solid Friends who knew the circumstances,
gave me to understand that I had nothing to fear from them,
inasmuch as my communications applied to the state of things there,
and to these individuals in particular.

If thou hast received all my previous letters, thou wilt find that I left Sheffield,
in Yorkshire, on the 6th of 2nd month,
and passed through many of the midland counties on my way up to London, where,
thou wilt have heard, I arrived on the 18th of last month;
but afterwards went back into Hertfordshire, and attended their Quarterly Meeting;
then returned immediately to London,
and attended all the meetings in the city and its neighborhood,
which I left on the 2nd inst., and went into the county of Kent, to Rochester,
and there was at William Rickman`'s, who was in America some years since;
and then to Canterbury, Dover, Folkestone, Hastings, Lewes, and so to this place;
keeping mostly on the seashore since leaving Dover.
The King and Queen reside here much of their time;
their palace is in the midst of the town,
and but a few yards from the house of our friend, John Glaysier, where I am now writing;
but they are at present in London.

I have a prospect of following the shore about eighty miles further west,
and then wheel to the north and northeast, making towards London,
so as to be at the Yearly Meeting, if it should appear safe, on account of the cholera,
which, I hear, has very much abated there within two or three days.
I never fail to think of thee, my love, every day,
but have thought more of thee within a few days than usual;
and thy letter produced very lively emotions in my mind,
and sympathy with thee in thy bereaved and tried state;
and the desire and prayer of my heart is,
that thou mayst be strengthened and enabled to hold out,
until in the ordering of Truth the time shall come for me to be restored to thee again.

And He whom I have ever found to be good and kind to all who trust in his providence,
and patiently endure all their privations, will stay and support thee,
and lighten every burden; and by looking to Him,
and dwelling near his power and the pavilion of his goodness,
thou wilt find him to be thy present helper and thy exceeding great reward; which,
my dear, is my longing desire for thee and for our dear children, relations,
and friends.

The Quarterly Meeting at Brighton was held on the 10th,
in which the public labor fell to my lot, as also the next day, at their Monthly Meeting,
and both to good satisfaction.
After the latter, I travelled thirty miles to Chichester, and, next day, the 12th,
had a meeting with the few Friends there; after which, I went to Portsea,
and had an evening meeting, where only two members of our Society live;
but several others came in, and we had an open time,
wherein considerable encouragement was administered.
Next day, we went to Southampton, and had a meeting at six o`'clock,
and I was much enlarged in the gospel amongst them.
On seventh day, the 14th, I went to Poole, and lodged at William and Mary Binns`'s.

We have now travelled from Dover, nearly two hundred miles by the seashore;
the meetings attended are mostly very small, and the state of things, in divers places,
very low, but still it seems to have been a time of awakening and renewal,
and I have some hope that my arduous labor among them will not be wholly lost;
and I feel abundantly bound to acknowledge the goodness of God in affording help to me,
a poor, unworthy laborer, as well as encouragement to this scattered people;
for they are few in number, and live remote from each other.

At Poole we attended their morning and evening meetings, which were open,
especially the former, in which I was much enlarged in doctrine; and, in the latter,
to some who were in a state of great barrenness, as regards religion,
some close and alarming hints were given.
Next day, the 16th of 4th mo., we went to Fording Bridge and had a favored meeting,
and the 17th, to Andover, having a meeting with T. H. and his family,
which constitutes the whole meeting.
It was now a silent one.
I was surprised that a meeting of Friends should be sustained by a gay family like this,
for there was no appearance in their habit like Friends, except in his wife;
and she a good deal in the background as to dress; nor did I think the meeting kept,
or the testimony supported, to the honor of Truth.

Next day we went to Basing-stoke and had an open meeting there,
and the day following to Alton and had another,
in which the people were strongly cautioned against departing from
the advanced ground which our worthy predecessors had taken.
But alas! when I came to mingle with a large company of them in the evening,
I found that there was already a great departure from our principles,
and the testimonies of Truth, as professed and practised by our primitive Friends;
and I felt restrained from much familiarity, lest I should quiet their consciences, and,
in some degree, become a partaker in their deviations;
for besides the gayety of their dress,
I found that some of them were practising the compliments and conversation of the world,
and were bold in it.
Next day, went to Guilford and had an evening meeting, and much close, searching labor;
finding, as I apprehended, much obstruction in the minds of some,
which prevented the flowing of the gospel current; however,
much labor and some encouragement were bestowed upon the young people.

At this place, my kind friend Samuel May left me, and returned home,
and Daniel P. Hack of Brighton met me here, in order to accompany me for a time.
On the following day, we visited a sick Friend and travelled to Godalming, where,
on the following morning, we had a meeting with Friends, and much labor in it,
and quietness followed.
The state of things here is mournfully low;
most of the children of Friends have left the Society;
divers of those from the first families have joined the Episcopalians,
and some of those who have not,
would not be suspected of belonging to the Society of Friends.
In the evening we had a meeting with the town`'s-people,
in which I was much opened and enlarged in declaring
the practical doctrines of the gospel,
and the meeting concluded with solemn supplication.

We found that the principal Friends of this place did, some years ago,
join with what was called the Bible Society, composed of bishops, priests,
and people of divers denominations;
and if the parents could cordially join with the hireling clergy and others,
in an association for the purpose of promoting religion, by spreading the Scriptures,
the children, not being able, as might be supposed,
to distinguish soberly between such an association,
and one distinctly for the purpose of religious communion, were led away, as a believed,
by a frequent association with such, and induced to join with other denominations.

In the early time of the Bible Association,
it appears that the clergy rather courted the favor of Friends--made very free with them,
and spoke very interestingly to them, and of them,
and this naturally produced its like in Friends,
and for want of being sufficiently guarded, it is to be feared that they were,
in too many instances, pleased with these worldly dignitaries,
who thus obligingly smiled upon them, and of course Friends were induced to speak well,
yea, and to think well of them; hence the young people among Friends,
who had not the maturity of judgment to make the right allowance and discrimination,
were gradually prepared, by what seemed to them a kind of toleration,
not only to embrace their parents`' associate, the priest, but his principles, too.
For the motto is true, "`The better we like a man,
the less we dislike his principles or conduct.`"

It is fully my belief that when Friends have joined with the clergy and others,
in those religious and benevolent associations, it has had a very insidious tendency,
to a compromise of principle, and to a dimming of the beauty,
or lessening the estimation of our testimonies;
if not to the quieting of the consciences,
and allaying the convictions in their minds relative to that oppressive
and wicked thing of forcing a maintenance from Friends and other dissenters,
as well as from their own members.
And I think Friends will not stand clear of iniquity in thus joining,
unless they are plainly honest,
and give them clearly to understand that by thus joining with them in a good thing,
they will not be considered as conniving at their practice in other respects,
nor partakers with them in their deeds.

These observations, made on the state of things at Godalming, will, I apprehend,
hold good if applied to many other places in England, and, although,
as some Friends have suggested, this intercourse, by means of these associations,
may have been of some apparent benefit to others, yet I am persuaded,
from my observation and sense of the thing,
that the unguarded usage and familiarity allowed in such
intercourse have done a vast deal more harm to us,
than good to them.
And if by such an intercourse, they should one day be found in greater unison with us,
in principle and practice,
I suspect it will be owing not so much to their advancement as to our retrogression.

I am not able to discover any more safety in our mingling with other people,
than there was for the Israelites under the law.
The command to them was "`thou shalt dwell alone,`" but we need not suppose that this
was a prohibition to others from joining with the Israelites or their peculiar testimonies.
The restriction upon Israel, regarding an intercourse with other nations,
was far from a preclusion of all others from the favor of God.
The Moabites, Edomites,
and Ishmaelites were all the descendants of Abraham and Lot his friend, and,
in their way, were religious people, especially the two former nations;
nor do I remember to have seen any account that the
Israelites were commanded to exterminate either.

But now, in the present day,
it may be argued that other sects are also professors of Christianity, as well as we;
and so it may also be said that some of those nations believed in,
and worshipped the same God, and, like Israel, offered slain beasts upon their altars,
by the hands of a priest;
an undeniable representation of the office and offering of a mediator.
And they were not probably farther behind the testimonies of their neighbors,
than the generality of professors are, in the present day, in faith,
behind the pure testimonies of the primitive Quakers.
And, if needful,
I should have no fear of losing anything by detailing
a comparison of all the essential differences.
Balaam had, undoubtedly,
been a man highly favored,--a prophet,--and might
have remained so to the end of his days,
but for his giving way to love the wages of unrighteousness--the bane of religion then,
and the bane of religion now!

If a union were to take place between our Society and others,
it would evidently be a great loss, both to ourselves and the world at large,
if we were to meet them upon any other ground than that premised by the gospel,
in its exalted and pure state--the high mark aimed at, and, in an eminent degree,
come to, by our predecessors.
Below this, there is no object to be looked for, or obtained,
that can possibly make amends for its loss or abandonment.
If we, by joining with other professors,
might contribute in any way to the bringing of the heathen to their standard, if,
at the same time,
it led to the levelling of our own,--the loss would be vastly more to us,
than the gain to them.
But we cannot join them, in their way, in a missionary concern to the heathen,
or to any other people, but at the expense of our noble testimonies.

It was undoubtedly because the Israelites had peculiar testimonies in advance of others,
that the Almighty prohibited their intercourse with them.
He who searcheth the heart and trieth the reins, knoweth the weakness of man,
and his liability to assimilate to the opinions of those with whom he intimately associates;
therefore, lest the Israelites should imbibe the views and ways of their neighbors,
to the loss of their own testimonies, He put a prohibition upon an intimacy with them.
Human nature is the same now as it was then;
hence it is as needful now on the part of our Society to maintain the boundary,
or line of demarkation, as it was then for the Israelites,
lest our doctrines and testimonies be lost in the
common mass of formal and literal professors.

In the course of my travels in England, I have heard Friends speak favorably of,
and even apologize for, the practice of the clergy,
in the collection of tithes of all the land,
alleging that he who buys land buys it so much the cheaper on account of the tithe,
and he also who rents a farm is considered on account of the tithe that it is liable to;
and he who buys land that is tithe-free,
pays more for his title than he would do if the tithe rested upon it.
All which admitted, still,
whatever effect or difference of bearing there may be upon buying or selling,
renting or letting, it proves nothing in favor of the principle of tithes;
for every additional demand upon the land, whether tithes or taxes,
tends to squeeze and press down the farmer,
(and in this country they are mostly tenants,) and to increase the burden,
both of the farmer and of the laborer;
for if the farmer has a very heavy burden upon him,
it is impossible for him to pay as much for labor as if the demands upon him were lighter.

Now, to test the foregoing question, we will suppose a man has a farm to sell or let,
situated in a place where it is subject to be robbed and plundered by freebooters,
of much of the fruit that can be grown upon it,
insomuch that the owner cannot sell it or let it for so much as he otherwise could;
is this any justification for robbery and freebooting?

But some plead further excuse for the clergy,
inasmuch as the law of the land makes it their right.
To this argument, I would reply that the laws of the Carolinas, as I have been informed,
tolerate the kidnapping a free person of color, wherever he can be found in those States,
and authorize the kidnapper to sell him as a slave,
and put the proceeds of the traffic into his own pocket.
Now, I would ask, do these laws palliate the wickedness of such a deed,
in any way whatever?
How much more, then, does an unjust law, made in the barbarous reign of Henry VIII.,
palliate this unjust practice of forcing away a part of the poor farmer`'s produce,
when it is grown by the industry of his hand, and the blessing of Divine Providence?

On second day morning, the 23rd, we went to Horsham, where we had a meeting that evening,
and, next day, to Ifield.
At this place we had a meeting in the morning, and, in the afternoon,
went to Capel and had an evening meeting there, and, on the day following, to Dorking,
where, at eleven, we had a very favored meeting,
and in the evening we had a meeting with Friends at Reigate,
and paid a visit to a valuable minister, now aged,
and so infirm as to be confined to her bed, but in a precious, sweet frame of mind;
and it was truly comfortable to be with her.
Next day, we had a meeting in the morning at Esher,
and in the evening at Kingston-upon-Thames; and all, I think, during the last week,
might be called seasons of favor, although, in several of them,
some close matter was administered.

The day after, we went to Staines, and had a meeting there in the morning,
which was truly a refreshing time to me, and I believe also to Friends.
We then went to Uxbridge, and had an evening meeting,
in which I was much enlarged in doctrine; and on seventh day, on our way to Amersham,
we made a little stop at the ancient meeting-place at Jordan`'s.
The house and premises are kept in good order,
though no constant meeting is kept there.
In the burying-ground lie, in one row, the remains of William Penn and his two wives,
Isaac Penington and wife, Thomas Ellwood and wife, and George Bowles and wife.
We dined at Samuel Allen`'s, at Amersham, and afterwards went to High Wycombe, where,
next day, the 29th of 4th mo.
and first of the week, we attended their fore and afternoon meetings.

I was silent in the former, and pretty long so in the latter,
but a way was finally opened to recur to the signs of the times,
and to allude to the various ways and means which
the enemy of man`'s happiness has adopted,
for the last two centuries, to lay waste the Christian church, so called,
alternately inducing them to exclude either the one
or the other part of the true Christian covenant;
that unbelief of either that part relating to what has been done for us without us,
by Christ`'s outward coming and mediation, or in his second coming,
without sin unto salvation, by his grace, spirit, and power in our hearts,
to our practical guidance into all Truth--that an unbelief
in either of these legitimate members of the Christian covenant,
will frustrate our salvation;
and the Friends present were therefore exhorted to
faithfulness in the whole covenant of Christian redemption,
and assured that neither part could be safely dispensed with.

Next day, the 30th, went to Maidenhead, and had a meeting with the few Friends there,
and afterwards to Reading, and had an evening meeting, to good satisfaction.
We lodged with our beloved friends Thomas and Susanna Bigg, both ministers,
she having once visited America on a mission of the Gospel.
Their company was cheering and comfortable.
Next day afternoon, went to Newbury, and had an evening meeting there;
and divers of the town`'s-people, by seeing us pass towards the meetinghouse,
discovered that a stranger had come, and soon came and sat with us,
and a precious meeting we had.
Next day, went to Farringdon, had a very unsettled, painful meeting;
for I do not think there were more than ten minutes at any one time,
when there were not some either going out or coming in,
and a number of the Friends themselves were not clear of restless conduct;
yet the disturbance was mostly owing to the rude behavior of some children,
who came in from the street; but truly my mind was pained, more than all,
on account of what, I apprehended, was the state of some who, in point of age,
were not children.

Next day, the fifth of the week and 3rd of 5th mo., went to Cirencester,
and had a very open and savory meeting there in the morning, and, in the evening,
one at Painswick.
On sixth day, went to Gloucester, where we had a silent meeting.
This was a day of great distress and conflict of spirit,
insomuch that I felt entirely unfit either for meeting or company,
for conversation was very painful to me; nevertheless,
as two meetings were beforehand appointed, I could do no less than attend them;
and in that in the evening, which was at Cheltenham,
my burden and darkness began to be dispelled, and my tongue was loosed,
and I seemed to myself like one raised from the dead; and it was a favored meeting.

Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, 5th mo., 5th, 1832.

[.salutation]
My Beloved Wife,

Be assured that neither distance nor time can lessen the
love and sympathetic feeling which abounds in my heart,
and flows towards thee and all our dear children;
and my desire and prayer to God for you is,
that if it be consistent with his blessed will,
he would preserve your health and spare your lives,
so that I may see your faces again in the flesh;
and what is still of vastly higher consequence to you and to me,
that you may be enabled always to live in his fear,
and to reverence and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind;
and then come what may, his blessing will rest upon you,
and he will give you strength to endure whatever afflictions
he may see meet to permit to fall in your way.

And this dispensation of Divine Providence which has thus
separated us for a time from each other will,
I hope, through his blessing, be found profitable, not only to thee,
but to me and to our children;
and I desire that the feeling remembrance of their absent and afflicted parent may in
the end result in as much good to them as would my presence if I were with them;
and I often think of them with longings not easily satisfied,
that love and joy and peace may be thine and theirs,
to your mutual consolation and comfort;
and although I am often in the furnace of affliction,
yet seeing it is preparatory for service,
the better to do the work in which I am engaged, I repine not,
but endeavor to rejoice in tribulation, hoping it may prove my preservation from falling;
for truly, I daily see the necessity of divine preservation and protection,
for I also clearly see that such a work as this cannot be done without danger
and exposure to the temptations and attacks of the enemy of all good;
for he greatly envies all those who are endeavoring to weaken his kingdom;
so that they feel (if indeed wisdom be given them)
the necessity of watchfulness and prayer for preservation;
yea, and they also feel to want the prayers of all that are capable of feeling for them.

And truly, my dear love,
I think there are none who can feel so keenly as thou and our beloved children;
and I comfortably hope, therefore,
to have your united desire and prayers for my preservation;
and I can but acknowledge that I feel much indebted
to many congenial hearts in this land,
who have made my life as their life, and have lifted up their hearts, yea,
and their voices too, unto the Father of all our sure mercies,
for my preservation and comfort.
But after all, I am aware that preservation is only to those who live near to Him,
the fountain of love and light, in which the enemy cannot dwell.

Thine,

On first day,
we attended their fore and afternoon meetings at Tewksbury--silent in the former,
but open in plain dealing in the latter.
Next day, we went to Evesham, and had a meeting there at six o`'clock,
nearly silent on my part, but my companion, D. P. Hack, had good service.
Here we lodged with our dear friend Richard Burlingham.
The day following, went to Campden, and had a good encouraging meeting with four Friends,
the whole number belonging here; and afterwards went to Chipping Norton,
where we had an evening meeting, very laborious;
it was hard to make any impression upon their hearts,--or, at least, upon some of them,
who seemed to resist the message of truth.

Next day, we went to Burford, and had a meeting in the room of Hannah Huntly,
an aged Friend, unable to go out; a sweet meeting it was,
and my companion was exercised in supplication.
(At this place,
I received the first account of my daughter Hannah`'s
illness.) From hence we went to Witney,
and had an evening meeting there, where we met with our dear friend Amelia Brown:
this was a heavenly, precious meeting,
(to which many came who were not members of our Society,) and was concluded
in prayer by our dear sister A. B. We lodged here at Daniel Rutter`'s,
who went with us, next morning, to Charlbury, where much labor,
by myself and my companion, was bestowed, and I have some hope that it was not in vain.

After this, we travelled twenty-one miles to Abingdon,
and sat with the two Friends who constitute this meeting,
and a number of their neighbors, who also attended; it proved a strengthening season,
I believe, both to the visited and visitors.
Next morning, Robert Allen, though aged, went with us to Wallingford,
where also we had an open meeting, and that same evening, another at Henley.
The following day, we went to Wycombe, and in the evening, to Amersham, and next day,
first of the week, sat with Friends there in the morning, and an open,
comfortable meeting it was.
Afternoon, at Chesham, where I was silent, but my companion had considerable service.
On the 14th, we went towards London, and had a meeting at Brentford, which proved,
after long silence, to be an arousing time, and I felt great peace.
We arrived in London in the evening, and went to my former lodgings,
at my dear friend Peter Bedford`'s.

On third day, the 15th of 5th mo., I attended their Monthly Meeting at Southwark,
and there met with my dear friend Stephen Grellet, much improved in health.
He had considerable service, but I was silent.
Here a young minister, belonging to this Monthly Meeting,
was very officious and active--his preaching, though literally correct, did not,
in power, rise much above the letter.
Next day, went to Hammersmith, and attended their mid-week meeting--very small,
but way opened for some instructive counsel, and we were, in the end, refreshed.

[.letter-heading]
From Betsey Purinton to John Wilbur.

[.signed-section-context-open]
Providence, R. I., 4th mo., 6th, 1832.

Of our venerable friend, Moses Brown, now in his 94th year,
it is not too much to speak often.
Of his illness, thou hast probably heard; since which,
I have often heard it observed that his intellect
appears brighter than for some time past.
He is rarely missing from meeting,
even when the weather looks unsuitable for his juniors,
and can ascend the gallery with less difficulty than heretofore;
is quite active in our meetings for discipline,
and has sometimes spoken in meetings for worship.

At the time of the decease of his daughter-in-law, Avis Lockwood, he was so ill,
that it required the assistance of two to get him into his chair,
and his debility was so great, it was not thought he could long survive her,
yet he sat through the meeting at the time of her interment,
and when William Almy supplicated, he was unable to rise,
but spoke with much feeling and great brokenness of spirit,
bearing ample testimony to her worth and exemplary
deportment since she had resided in his family,
a period of more than thirty years,
and of his confidence in her peaceful close,--and further added,
that it had long been the chief concern of his mind,
that his days might wind up in peace with Him, whom above all others he desired to serve,
and who only knew the conflicts through which he had passed,
as well as the comfort and consolation received from his hands; and now,
while the outward man was failing, that the inward man might renew its strength;
that he might not be suffered to dishonor the Truth, or that cause he had, though feebly,
endeavored to espouse; and much more to the same effect;
and it was truly a baptizing season, and, I believe, there was not a dry eye in the room.
Nicholas Brown, sat before me, and wept like a child,
as did many of his gay relatives assembled with us,
to whom M. B. spoke with much brokenness, as they took him by the hand,
at the close of the meeting.

The account of the decease of dear J. Taylor was affecting,
but we rejoice to hear of the good health of our other dear countrymen, who will,
doubtless, attend the Yearly Meeting, in London, to whom is our united love.
I often think of you, in your pilgrimage, but trust He that put forth is going before,
not only in opening, but in filling from his own blessed storehouse,
from whence things both ancient and new are brought forth,
and though it may be no more than a few barley loaves, or a few small fishes, it will,
with the Master`'s blessing, sustain many a fainting soul.

The longer I live,
the more I feel the necessity of a deep indwelling with the spirit of Divine life,
and as my dear, aged kinswoman, (Comfort Collins,) used to say,
neither '`borrow nor steal,`' however in want; and this is not all,
but to be content with our little, and neither suffer ourselves to be bought or sold,
to gain the popularity of the world, or the applause of men.
I speak not, my dear cousin, these things for thee, but in general;
being what I have often to watch against, lest, in my manifold weakness,
the mess of pottage may slip between me and my Divine Master,
against which the injunction remains to be good--"`Watch.`"

On fifth day, the 17th of 5th mo., I attended Westminster Monthly Meeting,
where was also John Dimond, a minister from Exeter,
who spoke pretty early in the meeting, but I was long silent,
even after he took his seat; at length, however, a little opening came,
and from great weakness I was made strong, or rather,
the power of Truth was felt to flow through a medium of great weakness,
and my spirit was comforted, and, I believe, the meeting edified.
On sixth day I attended the Meeting for Sufferings, and on seventh day rested.
On first day, 20th, meeting fore and afternoon, at Devonshire-house, silent.
On second and third day, was held the Yearly Meeting of ministers and elders,
at Grace-Church Street, where my lot was suffering and silence.

On fourth day, the 23rd of 5th mo.
began the Yearly Meeting for discipline, at Devonshire-house, and continued,
by adjournments until seventh day, the 2nd of 6th mo.

On sixth day, the 25th, I was at the public meeting over the bridge, at Southwark,
wherein I obtained relief, and was comforted.
On first day, the 27th, was, in the morning at Stoke Newington, silent,
and at evening at Peel, enlarged in testimony and doctrine,
I believe to the refreshing of many.
On fourth day, the 3rd, public meeting at Grace-Church Street,
in which I was raised up and enabled pretty fully to speak of,
and to recommend the whole covenant.

Having never opened my mouth in any of the meetings for discipline until sixth day morning,
the 1st of sixth mo., I then asked, and obtained liberty to pay a visit to women friends,
in their meeting; and my dear friend Charles Osborne,
finding a similar engagement on his mind, obtained the like liberty;
and we went together, and were satisfied in our labors with our dear sisters.
Otherwise than this visit to the women`'s meeting,
I was silent throughout all the meetings for business, and was greatly exercised therein,
under a serious apprehension that everything was not right amongst them.
In this meeting,
great professions of faith in the mediation and atonement of Jesus Christ our Lord,
were made, and this profession was abundantly reiterated;
but still I mournfully felt a great want of that precious sweetness and savor of life,
which gives weight and solidity, as well as power, to a meeting; and without which,
all the professions of faith, however high and glowing, as to words,
are but as sounding brass, and a tinkling cymbal.

And I am more and more confirmed in the belief that the
most full and literally sound acknowledgment may be made,
of faith in the blood and sacrifice of Jesus Christ, our blessed Redeemer,
and without any reserve too,
but still it may be no more than in the oldness of the letter, and that,
for want of believing fully in,
and of being really and practically quickened by the living power of the gospel,
that calls to, and enables to keep the commandments of Christ our Lord,
by whose spirit and grace we are sanctified through obedience.
For those who livingly believe are thus sanctified, through obedience;
and those who are thus sanctified, cannot be otherwise than believers.

On account of overwhelming afflictions and weakness of body,
I was not able to attend the concluding sitting of
the Select Yearly Meeting on seventh day evening,
the 2nd; for my mental grief was such that I could not refrain from excessive weeping,
after the conclusion of the meetings for discipline; so,
under the kind superintendence of my friend George Crosfield,
I went immediately to my lodgings, and retired to my chamber,
where my head was as waters and mine eyes as fountains of tears,
in weeping for the backsliding of the sons and daughters of my people,
occasioning the face of the Beloved to be so turned from us,
in the day of our great necessity.

London, 6th Mo., 3rd, 1832.

[.salutation]
My Dear Wife And Children,

On the 30th ultimo, I received letters from T+++_______+++ and A+++_______+++,
which is the third time I have heard from you, since the sickness of our dear Hannah;
by which, and taking her constitution into the account, and her increasing weakness,
I am inclined to think, that I must give up seeing her any more;
and oh! if it is to be so,
how do I desire that she may be fully prepared for a heavenly mansion,
and that she may have a well-grounded hope towards God, through the mercies, mediation,
and redemption of our Lord Jesus Christ,
the blessed means appointed for the salvation of all who will come to him,
believe in him, and walk in the light of his blessed spirit.

If she should yet be in mutability when this letter arrives,
I hereby send her the assurance of my dear and tender love,
and great longing for her joy and consolation in the Lord,
and in the consummation of his love and goodness;
even that which has the blessed effect of bringing
us into resignation to his adorable will;
and gives to us the consoling evidence that we are his; and that we love him.
Then we shall be able to believe, that whether in sickness or health,
whether in life or death, we are the Lord`'s;
and that he has provided a blessed mansion for us.
How I desire that this may be the hope and faith of us all,
my dear and precious wife and children, and that we may be invariably resolved,
so to seek the Lord, and to walk in his love and fear,
that we may find him to be near to us, and to keep us from evil.

I have in the main borne up pretty well under the
afflictions which have seemed to await me of late;
both as it regards the state of things with you,
and those immediately connected with my engagements here;
but my lot has been a tried one,
during most of the time of this long Yearly Meeting which concluded yesterday, and,
including the Select Meeting, has been in session now two weeks,
having two sittings every day but one, all of which I have attended except the last.
Some things that have transpired, have been painful to me, as well as to many others.
This meeting had a proposition before it, referred by minute from last year,
to enter into some measures "`to carry the knowledge of
the gospel to the heathen,`" by raising a fund for the purpose;
but there appears to be various minds, as it regards the appropriation of it.

Some are for helping other societies in their missions--some are
for encouraging our ministers to go forth to convert the heathen;
and others only to encourage school teachers to go and instruct them.
Altogether, it produced a very painful excitement in the Yearly Meeting,
but was eventually carried so far that a committee was appointed to consider the subject,
and report next year.
In all the discussions before this meeting, I found it my place to be silent;
but have had pretty extensive service in the public meetings during the Yearly Meeting,
at Grace-Church Street, Southwark, and Peel;
and a very relieving time in the women`'s meeting.
My prospect is to stay about London for a week or so, but not in the city;
and then to pass through the west of England and Wales,
attending some meetings in those parts, and about the last of the 7th mo.
to go to Ireland.

Daniel Prior Hack will probably keep with me a month longer,
when my friend George Crosfield proposes to meet me again.
He is now in London, and has during the course of Friends`' deliberations,
evinced much weight of character; and the suggestions of none were better attended to,
nor, as I think, more to the purpose.
I expect to leave London the day after tomorrow, and spend a few days at Croydon,
ten miles from this place, with John Barclay, a plain, honest, interesting Friend,
and a direct descendant of the Apologist.
He and his affectionate wife seem very desirous that
I would spend a few days at their house;
and as I feel to want a little rest, and time to write,
I conclude to accept their kind invitation, and take a little country air.
Thomas Shillitoe has just been in my chamber, and desires his dear love to you all.
Give my love to all my dear friends, and I should take pleasure in naming many,
if time would admit.

In great love I am yours,

On third day, the 5th of 6th mo., I went to Croydon,
to the house of my friend John Barclay, to rest a few days,
and next day attended a marriage there,--silent.

On sixth day, had a solid time with the scholars here.
On first day, with Friends in the morning, and others in the afternoon, both solid,
open times.
My dear friend, Ann Coning, from Yorkshire, being here also,
had good service in the public meeting.
On second day, my friends John and Mary Barclay went with me, by postchaise, to Peckham,
and made a social visit to Samuel Cash and wife; and next morning went to London,
where we attended Devonshire-house weekday meeting, and also their Select Meeting.
Here I was much opened in doctrine and exhortation,
and reminded Friends how much had been done for the Society in that city,
both early and late, and of the impression I had had of it that morning,
as I had walked their streets; and called upon them, in much feeling of gospel love,
to come faithfully forward in support of the testimonies which had been given our fathers,
and us, to bear; and in conclusion,
the youth were feelingly and affectionately invited
to a full submission to the grace of God,
and the blessed power of the gospel.
Much solemnity was felt to spread over the meeting.

On fourth day I was at Grace-Church Street Meeting, and Select Meeting.
Here I was shut up for a while, but, at length, light sprung up,
and a call and invitation were extended to come to
the one blessed source of eternal strength and power,
even to Christ Jesus, our hope, the Rock of Ages, and the author of our salvation.

By the attendance and service of these two meetings,
my mind was considerably relieved of a burden that had rested upon it,
through much of my stay in the city this last time,
and I now felt easy to leave it for the present.
I went, the same evening, to Abram Rawlinson Barclay`'s, (brother of John,) who,
with his sister Lydia, were very kind.
Next day, sat with Friends at Plaistow, and had some close, relieving service among them;
made several calls, in a religious way, and dined at Samuel Gurney`'s. In those calls,
I was accompanied by his sister, Elizabeth Fry, and by Mary and Lydia Barclay;
we returned, and lodged again at A. R. Barclay`'s, and, next morning,
called at Robert Barclay`'s,
(another brother,) whose wife is sister to Hannah C. Backhouse, now in America.

After this call, I went to Tottenham, and spent two days in writing,
and visiting Friends there and at Newington; and on first day, the 17th,
went to Winchmore Hill, and had a blessed meeting there,
wherein tongue and utterance were mercifully given,
both in testimony and supplication;--the Lord be praised forever,
for he is my only helper!
In the afternoon, I was at their large meeting at Tottenham,
which was rather laborious and painful;
and as much peace as at some other times was not experienced.

Here my kind friend, Daniel P. Hack, again joined me as a companion; and on second day,
the 18th of 6th mo., went to Hemel-Hempstead, and had a meeting there at six o`'clock,
which was pretty long silent and painful, but at length the clouds were dispelled,
and the trumpet of alarm was blown among them,
and my companion joined me in calling them to the life and power;
and the meeting ended well.
Here my former kind companion, Samuel May, came twenty-three miles to meet with me,
and we were rejoiced to see each other; he stayed the night with me, and then we parted.

Next day, went in the morning to Berk-Hempstead, and had an open, soul-solacing meeting,
in which the invitation of the gospel of Christ ran forth like the limpid stream,
to the watering and contriting of several tender minds among the young people; and,
I believe,
that all were sensible of the precious descending of the celestial
shower that fell upon us,--blessed be the name of Israel`'s helper!
Afternoon, went to Aylesbury, and had an evening meeting with the few Friends,
and a considerable number of their sober neighbors,--very open,
and the doctrine of life and power was exalted over form and ceremony.

Next day, had a painful, silent meeting at Buckingham, and went, the same evening,
to Adderbury, where, on the following day, we had a heavenly, solacing meeting,
and my companion was exercised in living prayer.
From hence we went, the same evening, to Banbury, and had a comfortable meeting there,
and, next day, at Sibford, which, on my part, was silent;
and this example of silence was, I trust, in the Lord`'s will and purpose;
being confirmed, near the close, that there are too many attempts at preaching here.
After this, we went to Eatington, and lodged at Jeffrey Low`'s, and next day,
with the very small number who belong here, we had a sweet opportunity,
and exhortation and encouragement went forth freely, especially to the young people.

From thence to Warwick, where in the forenoon we sat with Friends, and, I believe,
instruction was given, and help afforded to speak to the conditions of many present,
some of whom were broken into tenderness.
Afternoon, had a meeting with the town`'s-people,
in which it appeared to be my business to open the plan of Christian Redemption,
through the blessed mediation of Christ Jesus, outwardly and inwardly, and,
as I continued speaking, the power rose and increased, and it became a solid,
baptizing time.

On second day, the 23rd of 6th mo., we went back towards Banbury,
and had a little meeting with Friends at Radway, in which the alarm was sounded to some,
and encouragement to others, and we left peacefully,
and came the same evening to Banbury.
The Select Quarterly Meeting was held here the evening of our arrival, and next day,
their public Quarterly Meeting, and that for discipline.
I was silent throughout, and, as I believe, for an ensign and an example to others;
for there were many offerings made in this meeting, several of which, I think,
might well have been spared.
The same evening, we travelled fourteen miles to Shipston,
and attended their Select Quarterly Meeting, in which my tongue was again loosed,
both in doctrine, regarding the ministry,
and also in sympathizing encouragement to some of the weary travellers.

Next day came on the public Quarterly Meeting,
at which were many Friends in the ministry from different parts of the nation;
among them were Anna Braithwaite, from Kendal, Thomas and Susanna Bigg, from Reading,
John Dimond from Exeter, and John Foster, from Luton.
But the public service in the ministry fell mostly to my lot.
On parting with my dear friends, Thomas and Susanna Bigg, we had a solid opportunity,
and she manifested much sympathy and gospel fellowship with me,
and cried to the Lord for his help and guardian care over me,
in these my travels and various exercises in a foreign land;
and also for my dear wife and children was this dear friend engaged to petition,
that the Lord would be her hiding-place, and their caretaker.
And such were the pourings out of my spirit towards these dear friends,
thus made near in a foreign land,
that I could tenderly reciprocate their feelings and intercessions,
insomuch that I did truly desire their safe keeping upon the sure foundation,
and their happiness through the remaining toils of life.

After this solid parting, we travelled to a place called Stow-in-the-Woalds, where,
next morning, we had an opportunity with the few Friends there,
and I was led to bear a full testimony against the spirit of this world,
and too close a pursuit of it.
From hence we went to Cirencester, and, next morning, to Nailsworth,
and had a meeting there,--open and comfortable; from thence travelled to Olveston,
and lodged at John and Ann Beards, and, next morning,
had a meeting with Friends of this place and those of Thornbury together;
it being the first of the week, and 1st of the 7th mo., and at six o`'clock,
had a meeting at Frenchay, where Friends from a neighboring meeting also met us.

The first, was open and favored; the last, laborious.
We went, next morning, to Lawrence-Weston, and attended their Monthly Meeting;
and here we met again with Amelia Brown with a certificate;
but the labor fell upon my companion and myself.
From here we went to Bristol, and had a meeting, by appointment, at Friers,
the same evening.
This is called the largest meeting of Friends in England.
Here I was pretty long silent; but Truth arose at length,
and we had a solid time with them.
Lodged at Samuel Capper`'s, and next day went to Bath, where we had a very open,
searching meeting.

In the afternoon, at Calne, I was silent.
We lodged at William Gundry`'s, and next day, the 4th, went to Melksham, and had an open,
interesting meeting there.
Here reside our valuable friends, George Withy and Rachel Fowler,
ministers in good esteem.
The former not at home; the latter is sister to Deborah Derby, once in America,
but now deceased.
We spent a little time with dear Rachel Fowler, at her son John`'s, very agreeably,
and from here we went to Frome and had a precious, renewing time with a few there;
and then to Shaftesbury, where I had an awakening testimony to some, who, as I believed,
were in much too easy a state.

From this place we went to Marnhull,
and had an evening meeting,--lodged with William and Rebecca Bird,
(late Rebecca Young;) these Friends, though aged,
seem to retain a precious portion of the savor of life.
From hence we went to Wincanton, and had (on my part) a silent meeting; we went,
next day, to Yeovil, where we had a meeting,
rather disturbed by two or three needless appearances; nevertheless,
I was enabled at length to relieve my mind among them, and went, the same evening,
to Bridport, and lodged at the house of our friend, William Forster,
where we were affectionately entertained for two nights.

Here, on first day, the 8th of 7th mo., we met with Friends, both fore and afternoon;
in the morning, I was silent, and, from some cause, under much exercise;
and in the afternoon, pretty long in the same state, but towards the close of the last,
several passages came, in succession, before the view of my mind; to wit,
Moses`' testimony of Christ,
"`Him shall ye hear,`"--the voice from heaven at two different times,
"`This is my beloved Son,
hear ye him,`"--that this was spoken in the presence of John the Baptist,
of whom it was said, "`Among those born of woman, a greater Prophet had not arisen,
than he;`" and it was also said, in the presence of Moses and Elias, upon the Mount;
by which it seems that a distinguished preference was given to hearing,
or listening to Christ, before the very best and greatest of men;
from which considerable doctrine was drawn,
showing the necessity of adhering to the grace and
spirit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

On parting with my friend W. F., he alluded to my visit and service here,
and observed that he had full assurance that it was in the ordering of wisdom,
and that my communication applied directly to some states present;
for that there were some in that meeting,
who were dissatisfied with him because he did not preach to them more;
and having learned that I had been frequently silent,
he observed that it would give weight to my service.
On the 9th of 7th mo., we went to Exeter, where, next day,
we visited several aged and infirm friends, and had a laborious meeting in the evening,
wherein a jealousy was entertained and expressed,
that the glory of the Lord was given too much to another,
and that they were too much making flesh their arm; but although I sat very long,
silently distressed, and afterwards also labored long among them, yet,
after all my travail and labors for the obtaining of good,
I found not a consummation of it, but left them with a heavy heart at last.

Next day we went to Kingsbridge, where we had a precious meeting in the evening.
An exhortation to faithfulness, and the language of encouragement, flowed,
like the limpid oil, to some present, whose minds were much humbled and tendered.
Next day we went to Modbury, where we had an open meeting with a few,
and then to Plymouth, to Sarah Abbot`'s, where I received letters from home,
by which I learned that there was now no expectation of
the recovery of my dear and precious daughter Hannah,
who has now been in declining health for three months, or nearly so,
and of whom my accounts heretofore had not been so unfavorable;
but now I find that I must give up all expectation of seeing her any more in this world.

And oh! how my heart is broken down in tenderness, under the consideration of losing,
thus, in my absence, so precious a child, innocent and lovely!
I feel also great commiseration for my dear wife, in her affliction,
under the prospect of losing her, thus in my absence,
and feel inexpressible tenderness for the dear child also,
in her sufferings and prospect of seeing me no more in mutability;
and for all my dear children, to whom this must be a very trying dispensation; and,
although I cannot forbear weeping, yet I know that resignation is best,
and I pray that God may give it me.

At Plymouth we had a meeting with Friends, and labored much in a doctrinal way,
open and satisfactory.
Our next was, the same evening, at Tideford, very open and comfortable.

Tideford, Cornwall, 7th.mo., 18th, 1832.

[.salutation]
My Dear Wife,

Last evening, at Plymouth, I received thine of the 3rd of 6th mo.,
by which I find that I must now give up our dear child into better hands than ours,
and apprehend that I must see her no more in this world.
I had not, before the receipt of this letter, entirely given her over; and however,
I trust, I have some assurance that she will, if she leave time now,
be received into the arms of our good and blessed Redeemer;
still my heart is much afflicted and melted down before the Lord,
in consideration of the circumstance of my now being in a distant land,
and not able personally to mingle in feeling with thee and with the dear sufferer,
and our other dear afflicted children;
for I am very sensible that you all must be greatly tried in the prospect of this dispensation,
and more especially seeing that I am not, nor can soon be with you in body; but oh,
my dear, I am much with you in mind, and weeping with you and over you.
And, oh, that I could but embrace my dear child before she goes hence! but, even now,
if I should leave my work undone here, and embark as soon as possible,
there seems to me to be much doubt of arriving timely to see her again;
so that I am brought to a great strait, and had a sorrowful night for the last;
but having two meetings appointed for today, and some distance to travel between them,
I seemed to be under the necessity of attending them; but truly, in travelling the road,
I have wept as I have gone, and strewed my tears in a land of strangers;
and surely I have said, I am a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief;
but still thy cause for grief is the same as mine,
and I doubt not that it is more sensibly felt by thee than by me;
but I do desire that thou may be supported through all,
and be enabled to trust and confide in the goodness and power of our blessed Helper.
And oh! if our dear child should be living when this comes to hand,
tell her that the prayers of her absent father are lifted up with tears and great tenderness
for the support of her precious mind under and through this solemn dispensation,
and that the Lord Jesus would make her his own,
and sanctify and fit her for a joyful inhabitant of his blessed kingdom, where,
through the mercies and protection of redeeming Power, I hope also one day to arrive.
Oh! how full my heart is of unbounded love towards her.
Tell her never to be dismayed at the dark vale through
which lies the way to life and glory,
where the redeemed shall come with everlasting songs of honor and glory to the Lord,
and where all sorrow and mourning and trouble shall cease,
and joy unspeakable shall be their portion forever and ever!

With the assurance of great love and tenderness of feeling,
which words fall short of expressing, I am thine and yours,

The next day we went to Looe, and met with four Friends, their full number,
of whom Sarah Tucket is a minister in good esteem.
From hence to Liskeard, to John and Elizabeth Allen`'s, to lodge;
and here we had a meeting with Friends in the morning,
and with others in the afternoon,--both highly favored, the first remarkably so.
Here lives a valuable minister by the name of Samuel Rundell, on whom we called.
Next day, to Austle, where we had an open meeting, and from thence, next day, to Redruth,
and had a meeting at three o`'clock,
and the day following attended their Monthly Meeting at Falmouth.

In these last two meetings I had much to say,
yet there was not that free flowing as at some former times;
and I found it needful to step carefully, as I could see but one sentence at a time.
On the next day we turned back,
(having come pretty near to the land`'s end in Cornwall,) and came to Truro,
where we had a meeting, first with Friends,
in which the current of the gospel ran freely, and it was felt to be a heavenly time;
then, in the evening, had a meeting for the town`'s-people, long gathering,
but quite open when settled, and much Christian doctrine was communicated to them;
but many of them appeared to be in great ignorance as to the true substance thereof;
yet it was, upon the whole, a pretty satisfactory opportunity.
From hence we went to a place called Wade-Bridge,
and had a very satisfactory little meeting with Friends there;
then went on towards Tavistock, and stopped to dine at a place called Launceston.
Here we viewed the ruins of the old castle where George Fox was once imprisoned.

On first day, the 22nd, we attended their meeting at Tavistock, morning and evening,
to good satisfaction, and on second day travelled thirty-three miles,
through Dartmoor Commons, to Exeter, and lodged at John Dymond`'s,
and next day to Spiceland, and had a meeting there, pretty open,
and then went to Wellington, and lodged at Sylvanus Fox`'s, where, next day,
we had a meeting, in which my labors were mostly on the subject of the ministry,
wherein understanding and strength were given me clearly to show
and demonstrate that the key of David has never yet been committed
into the hands of any man since the world began,
save the man Jesus only,
and that by him every opening must be made for the preaching of the gospel,
or every attempt for it will be in vain.

There are five or six persons here, who stand in the station of ministers;
but from my feelings and opening in this meeting,
an apprehension attended me that there is some unsoundness, either in faith or practice.
From this place we went to Taunton,
and had a meeting there the same evening--laborious and searching,
and some were thought to stand in great jeopardy of their lives, having,
as I was led to believe, much to do, and but little time wherein to do it.
From Taunton we went to Street, and, on the 26th, had a meeting there,
in which it fell to my lot to bear a faithful testimony against
the doctrine of unconditional election and reprobation,
and to show the effect of action and reaction upon Christendom,
for two or three centuries past,
by which the prince of darkness has wrought to the spoiling of the church.

The Calvinistic doctrine has been one extreme, and the Armenian and Socinian the other,
and the enemy has been driving many of the professors
of Christianity from the one to the other,
ever since the Reformation, which he hated with a perfect hatred;
and has done all in his power to frustrate the good designs of
God in his attempts to bring his church again out of the wilderness;
and has but too well succeeded in leading to great extremes,
and even to gross infidelity on the one hand,
and to the abominable doctrine of unconditional election and reprobation, on the other.

And it appears that too many in membership with us
are strongly tinctured with this last-named opinion,
in this day in England, to the great grief of the honest-hearted.
And I am persuaded that, where the leading and operation of divine grace is overlooked,
or lightly esteemed, although at the same time great professions are made,
of faith in the atonement,
(precious in itself,) that there will be a direct tendency
to fall into the heinous doctrine of election and reprobation.
And such, I have ground to fear,
is the case with some rather conspicuous characters in the Society; of which cases,
on account of their standing and influence,
it would be difficult to take cognizance by way of discipline;
so that the aspect of things in divers places, looks gloomy and mournful.

On sixth day, the 27th,
we had meetings at Long Sutton and Bridgewater--the former trying,
on account of a worldly spirit, and the latter silent.
Next day I wrote to my family, and went to Sidcot,
and had an opportunity with the scholars the same evening; and next morning,
first of the week, and 29th of 7th mo.
attended their meeting, and was silent therein; but my companion had some service.

Bridgewater in Sommersetshire, 7th mo.
28th, 1832.

[.salutation]
My Dear Wife,

In consequence of the intelligence conveyed by thy last letter,
connected with other things incident to such a work as this,
my pilgrimage is truly a mournful one;
and I have thought in passing along that I have now been
made to know more of the Cross of Jesus Christ our Lord,
than I ever knew before; being thus separated from thee,
my dear companion in tribulation, and from all our dear children,
without ability to participate personally in the greatest conflict which
ever outwardly occurred in our little group and vineyard of precious plants,
I often feel as if I must take the wings of the morning and fly to your relief,
and bathe in tears of commiseration with you,
for they are flowing freely while I am writing these lines,
as they have often done of late in my mental visits to you,
which have been very frequent.
I have often placed myself among you,
and beside the languishing bed of our dear child!
but I must forbear of this melting strain:
my heart is too full to follow it;
and I must look to the stay and staff which has through
all in great mercy been given me to lean upon,
and by which I have been supported far beyond what I could have supposed;
so that the work is going on as usual,
and I have often had to marvel in meetings that I was so lifted
up to declare the gospel of life and salvation among the people,
when at other times I have felt myself much more
an object to be ministered unto than to minister.
In great love to you all I conclude--especially to our dear H. if she be yet with you,
and oh! that she may freely and fully resign herself into the good hands of her God,
and of her father`'s God,
to whom with great tenderness and intercession for his mercy I resign her,
believing in the faith of the gospel that I shall joyfully meet her again,
if not in this, in the world to come.

In the afternoon, attended meeting at Claverham, where I was also silent.
Here I met with my dear friend Geo.
Withy, and lodged with him at his daughter`'s; next day went to Chew-magna,
and had an open meeting with the few there.
Next day we went to Bristol, and attended their midweek meeting, to which also came Geo.
Withy; the public labor fell to my lot, in which I found peace.
From Bristol, we went to Olveston, to John and Ann Beard`'s, where we rested two days,
and attended their mid-week meeting, and on sixth day, went to Claverham again,
to attend a funeral, where I was still silent,
I believe for the reason that preaching is made too easy there.

We lodged at John Naish`'s,
and next morning visited the widow and children of the deceased,
with whom we had a solid, refreshing season; and in the afternoon returned to Bristol,
and lodged again with my dear friend Samuel Capper; and next morning,
which was first day, attended this large meeting,
in which my companion first gave testimony to the Truth, and after him,
way was opened for blowing the trumpet of alarm among them,
and I believe many were brought to a deep searching of heart.
In the afternoon, having a cold and hoarseness, which had been upon me several days,
and feeling easy to omit the afternoon meeting, I went to Frenchay;
having now parted from my kind friend, and fellow traveller, Daniel P. Hack,
he feeling easy to return home.

On second day, the 6th, attended their Monthly Meeting,--open and instructive.
Whilst here, I wrote to my friend Moses Brown, in America,
and therewith sent him the work of Priscilla Gurney;
wrote also to several friends in England, from Frenchay.
On fourth day, the 8th, I went to Bristol, and took passage in a steam-packet to Newport,
a town lying on the north side of Bristol Channel.
Here, next day, I attended their Monthly Meeting,
and although weak in body and somewhat hoarse,
yet was considerably enlarged in testimony, and felt peace.
Here it was concluded to leave our horse and chaise to meet us at Brecon,
where the Half-Year`'s Meeting was to be held.
My friend, John Beard, having given up, for a time, to bear me company,
joined me at Frenchay, and came hither with me.

From this place, I took postchaise, with John and Elizabeth Harford, for Swansea,
in Wales, where we arrived the next evening,
and took lodgings with Robert and Jane Eaton, with whom I had before some acquaintance.
Here, being much indisposed, I stayed several days, rested, and took medicine.
But on second day following, feeling a little better, I set out with the same friends,
and travelled in the same way, towards Brecon, where we arrived the next afternoon,
and took lodgings at an inn.
Here the Half-Year`'s Meeting for Wales was to be held;
and the Select Meeting sat this evening, to which came Elizabeth Fry, and her brother,
and companion, from Plaistow, near London.

In this meeting I had a testimony to bear concerning our belief
in regard to the ministry,--exhorting my brethren and sisters,
exercised in the office, to trust in,
and hold fast their belief in the pure opening of the divine Spirit.
Here was also Sarah Squire, a minister from Huntingdonshire.
Next day was held, in the public hall, their Half-Year`'s Meeting,
for the principality of Wales.
This was, to me, a painful meeting throughout;
the Master`'s seal not being seen upon every offering made here,
and my lot was to set an example of silence.

A public meeting was proposed for this evening, by Elizabeth Fry, and appointed,
of which I had no sight, and took no part; and being indisposed, I kept to my chamber,
and there mourned over the state of things in this land,
being fully aware that there are many in the station of ministers, who are,
in great measure, lost, as to the times and seasons,
the openings and the shuttings of the blessed spirit of the gospel,
and whose minds seem to be so beclouded and darkened,
that the true shining is not seen to go forth with brightness as in primitive times,
nor as a lamp that should burn through the whole gospel day;
and it is greatly to be feared that there are some
who are leaning too much to their own understanding,
instead of waiting, in patience and meekness, on Jesus Christ, the great minister,
who always keeps the key in his own hands, and openeth only when he will,
and to whom he will.

And as I did heartily unite in spirit with my dear friend, Charles Osborn,
in the Women`'s Yearly Meeting, in taking up the lamentation of Jeremiah, viz: "`Oh,
that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears,
that I might weep day and night for the slain of
the daughter of my people!`" so I continue to mourn,
and to feel like adopting the prophet`'s subsequent language of grief,
as I pass through this land,
"`How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed! the stones
of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street!
The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold,
how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!`"
For lo! some who have shone apparently as stars of the first magnitude,
seem to be in danger of a total eclipse!
The outward standing and influence of some is such, that the case seems almost,
if not entirely, irremediable, and what the result of things will be,
is difficult to foresee; but many there are among this people,
who are truly awakened to serious and fearful apprehensions,
lest this Society should be shaken from its foundation.

From Brecon we went to Leominster, in Herefordshire,
in company with Edward and Eliza Southall, to the house of their mother, Mary Southall.
Here, on the 19th of 8th mo., I attended their fore and afternoon meetings,
which were satisfactory.
In that in the morning, I had some clear and striking openings,
as it regarded the leading and direction of some,
and my dear friend E. S. took it to herself, and seemed astonished, after meeting,
that her prospect and exercise should be so plainly opened to another,
and was broken into tears of tenderness.
On second day, we had a meeting at Hereford,
and returned again to Leominster the same evening, where we rested until fifth day,
the 23rd, and wrote; after which, we went to Bromyard,
with E. and E. Southall in company, where, next morning, we had a good meeting,
in which the last-named E. S. was sweetly exercised in prayer.

After this, we went to Worcester, and had a meeting there the same day,--very painful,
in which I had some close, searching labor;
fearing that some things here were not altogether as they should be,
and too many mere literal professors.
On seventh day, we went to Birmingham, and next day, attended both their meetings,
wherein I was much opened and enlarged in unfolding the substantial truths of the gospel,
and mercifully favored with the blessed ownings and help
of the Shepherd of Israel,--praised be his holy name!

On second day, we had meetings at Stourbridge and Dudley, and the day following,
travelled twenty-four miles to Coalbrookdale,
and lodged at Barnard Dickenson`'s. Next day, we had a satisfactory meeting there;
and my dear friend E. S., who had continued with us hitherto, now returned home.
On fifth day, the 30th, we went to Stafford, and lodged at an inn, and next morning,
had a little meeting there.
At this place, I met with C+++_______+++ T+++_______+++,
whom I had seen before at Sheffield,--a convinced Friend.
She was here now on a visit to her sisters, who are professors in the Church of England,
and pretty strong in their opinions.

We breakfasted with them, and way opened for some pretty free conversation,
so that their prejudices apparently gave way,
and three of them came to our meeting for the first time,--a blessed meeting
it was,--the life and power of Truth being prevalent among us.
These three sisters were seen upon their knees, while I was exercised in prayer.
From Stafford, we went to Leek, and lodged at Toft Chorley`'s; and next day,
to Stockport, and lodged at our dear friends, George and Ann Jones`'s;
and on the first of the week, to Manchester, where Ann Jones also went,
and we attended their large meeting, both fore and afternoon; in the morning,
the service fell to my lot, and afternoon,
mostly to Ann Jones,--both were satisfactory meetings.

On second day morning, having been met here by my dear friend, George Crosfield,
we went with him to Liverpool, where Ann Jones also soon came; and she,
with George and Margaret Crosfield, and Jonathan Flounders,
went into an examination of a series of letters which I
had written to George Crosfield on religious subjects;
and it was their united opinion,
that the state of things required the publication
of such matter as is contained in these letters;
and, with some revisal, it was thought best to publish them.

My Dear Wife,

My health is good,
and I am continuing to pursue the service before me as way opens for it;
but my progress as to travelling has been rather more deliberate of late,
on account of other service of a peculiar nature, which, I hope,
will not long protract my journeying, forward.
I have hitherto been very cautious in hinting, to any one on that side the water,
the state of things here; but, truly, their aspect is unpleasant and unpromising.
How much, or how great, is the impending danger, cannot well be determined now;
still I am disposed to hope for the best; but never did the necessity appear so great,
of being truly wise in that wisdom which is from above,
especially for those whose business and allotment is assigned
them in turning the battle to the gate.

My situation, then, my dear wife, is one of unusual exercise,
requiring great watchfulness;
and I feel to desire the prayers and uplifted intercessions of thy spirit,
and of all my friends in that much wished for country.
The state of things above alluded to, has already lengthened my service here;
and how much more it will do so, I cannot now foresee.
My prospect, however, continues to be, to go to Ireland before a great while.
There are many here, and some among the foremost rank, who are disposed to think,
that the writings of Robert Barclay and others among our ancient Friends, are incorrect,
and do not hesitate in so saying; and further say,
that the Scriptures are "`the Word of God,`" and the first,
if not the only rule of practice, as well as of faith;
and recommend that ministers rely upon them more and more for a qualification to preach.
And there appears to be such a powerful reaction from the Irish and American secessions,
that not a few Friends here are alarmed, lest while many are fleeing from Admah,
they will bring up at Zeboim.

My love is to thee, my dear, and to all our children and friends.

I stayed some days about Liverpool, and attended their meetings as they came in course;
and on second day, the 11th of 9th mo., set out for Nantwich,
in order to attend Cheshire and Staffordshire Quarterly Meeting there,
which convened on fifth day, the 13th, and was a profitable time.
After it was over, I went to Chester, and, on sixth day, had an open meeting there,
and returned to Warrington, where I met with my dear friend Charles Osborn,
from my own country, with whom we conferred about the publication of the letters,
of which he fully approved, and so I proposed going to London,
to lay them before the Morning Meeting for adjudication;
but was informed that such was not the usage now in England; which, though well known,
George Crosfield thought best to have official information of from London,
and wrote to William Manly for correct information.
(He is the Recording Clerk of the Yearly Meeting, the Select Yearly Meeting,
the Meeting for Sufferings, the Morning Meeting,
the Quarterly and Select Quarterly Meetings for London and Middlesex,
and the Six-Weeks`' Meeting.) He informed my friend George Crosfield, by letter,
that it was not the practice of Friends in England to commit the
inspection of manuscripts for publication to the Morning Meeting,
as had been heretofore the case;
and so I left the disposal of them to George Crosfield and other friends,
to do as they thought best with the letters.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

I fear thou wilt think me neglectful in not writing to thee before;
but one of my reasons is that I have been suffering from one of my old attacks,
but am thankful to be able to say I am better.
On my arrival home I found my dear Ann in good health,
which is a great favor in this awful time.
I think I may inform thee also that, for some days,
my mind was raised in thankfulness to the Shepherd of Israel,
for his goodness towards one of the most unworthy of all his flock; but oh,
that I may bow in humility at his footstool,
and there crave the blessing of preservation!

I can truly say that the Lord is good!
Blessed is the man that trusteth in him!
Often, since I left thee, has my mind been led into deep concern for thee,
my very dear friend,
that thou mayst be strengthened to do all that thy
gracious Master may have for thee to do in this land;
and though I am unworthy to encourage a brother in this important work, yet I am,
at times, made thankful that he has called thee into this field,
to labor for the promotion of truth and righteousness in the earth.
I do feel as though I might encourage thee to go on, for he has said,
"`I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.`"

What abundant cause there is for us to take courage,
and go on in his blessed work and service;
for there are no joys comparable to the joys of his salvation.
I hope, by this time, thou hast got on with thy little work,
and that Friends have been brought to see and to feel with thee in it.
Should that not be the case,
I do hope thou wilt be enabled to bring it forward by the help of thy dear Master,
who has called for it at thy hands.
Great is the reward of those who do his will.
That his choicest blessings may rest on thee, my beloved friend,
not only on the present occasion, but in all thy further labors amongst us,
is the fervent desire,--may I not say the prayer,--of my heart at this time.
In quietness and confidence shall be thy strength.

If, my dear friend, thou shouldst have to go again into the furnace of affliction,
if He who was seen walking in the midst of the fire with the three children,
be with thee, thou wilt have to rejoice, and not to wish thy suffering less.
If it was in my power, I should be glad to bear a part of thy sufferings;
but that cannot be.
May his eternal power be underneath to support thee.

Believe me to be thy sincere and affectionate friend,

From Warrington I returned again to Liverpool, and stayed a few days more,
and then went to Manchester and attended their Quarterly Meeting,
which took place on the 19th and 20th of 9th mo., where it was my lot to be silent,
but my dear friend C. Osborn had good service.
From Manchester I returned again to Liverpool, from whence I embarked for Ireland,
and landed at Belfast, after a comfortable passage of eighteen hours, on seventh day,
the 22nd of 9th mo., having my dear friend George Crosfield for my companion;
and on first day, attended their fore and afternoon meetings at Belfast; both open,
favored meetings, but the last long silent.

Next day I went to Antrim, and had a pretty close, searching time with the few there,
having to say that I believed some of them had known better days.
These were earnestly exhorted to repent and do their first works.
From hence we went to Low Grange,
and next day had an opportunity with Friends and a few of their neighbors,
which was a pretty open time.
After meeting we travelled twenty-three Irish miles, to Lisburn,
and lodged at James N. Richardson`'s,
and the day following had meetings at Ballindery and Hillsborough.
The former a precious opportunity, the latter long silent and laborious,
with some very close, searching labor towards the conclusion.
We dined with the wife and children of our friend Jacob Green,
who was now gone on a gospel errand to America--a plain, interesting family.
We returned again to Lisburn with Anna Richardson and her daughter Sarah,
who had accompanied us to the last two meetings.

On fifth day, the 27th, we attended their mid-week meeting at Lisburn,
which was open and satisfactory.
On sixth day the 28th, I received letters from my wife and daughter Lydia,
informing me of the death of my dear daughter, Hannah C. Wilbur.
She had been sick about six months, sometimes apparently convalescing,
and then again more poorly, so that my accounts of her had been variable,
and my mind had been much afflicted, on account of the sore trial to my family,
as well as on account of her sickness and the probable result of it;
and my state of separation from them and from my poor, languishing child;
and I not permitted personally to participate with
them in this great trial and affliction.

I was brought into deep searching of heart regarding this, my absence from my family;
but could not find that I was out of my place in the will of my divine Master,
nor could I feel easy, from the first, to return to America,
in order to see my dear child before she should go hence,
until my service in this land be finished; so I endeavored to be resigned to God`'s will,
and wait his disposal of all things which pertain to me and mine,
and to commit all into his hands.
But alas, when my apprehensions were realized, nature melted;
and I could do no less than shed a flood of tears!
But in the midst of all, as the account of her preparation for the event,
and her resignation, were so satisfactory, I endeavored to restrain my grief,
and to moderate my weeping for the loss of my dear child;
and for the affliction of my dear wife and beloved children.

My Dear Wife And Children,

Whilst at breakfast this morning I received the letters bearing date 8th mo.
25th,
which brought to me the solemn and heart-tendering account of the change
that has transpired in our little company--that one of us is no more!
And however solid and satisfactory the evidence,
that her precious purified spirit has gone to join the saints in light,
when that which I had greatly feared was confirmed to me as having really taken place,
my heart was filled with grief,
and mine eyes poured forth a flood of tears! and great was
and is the commiseration which I feel on her account.

Dear lamb! suffering--languishing in death!--called to leave her dear,
already bereaved mother, and all who on her lap were borne,
save that little innocent which went before!--nor father there
to help to raise her hope--on whom to rest her drooping head,
or unto whom to give her feeble hand!
Oh! could I, but for an hour, have soothed her lovely spirit!
But why lament?--'`twas more than earth could give.
A precious mother by her bed, a little brother--sisters dear around.

And what was more, and over all that earth can give, the angel of God`'s love, I trust,
was there--supported her--supported all!
But now I know that all the parental feeling, and all the longing of spirit,
cannot reach or avail her in her mansion.
Then I will endeavor, and let us all endeavor, my dear bereaved treasures,
to refrain from weeping, and to forego lamentation on her account; for I am assured,
that you have done the whole of your part, and as much of mine as was practicable;
and that all has been done that could have been done;
and if perfect acquiescence is our experience,
then I trust we shall see that all is in the ordering of Divine Providence,
and that all is well.

And O, I desire, however trying, not to murmur or complain of his dispensations.
The feeling of great sympathy now runs like a stream
towards you who were witnesses of the scene of affliction;
and at the same time, my dear love,
I have a heavy portion here in a strange land and among strangers;
but still there are some, where I now am,
who are not wanting in sympathy and commiseration.

My dear friend George Crosfield is here with me, and is a friend indeed,
and sticks as close as a brother.
And my friends, James N. Richardson and family, at whose house I now am,
are exceedingly kind and affectionate to me, none could be more so.
I had already been here for two or three days,
and have been attending meetings in the neighborhood, and returning; but today had been,
before, reserved for writing; and it is well that I had no appointment for it;
for truly I could not have attended a meeting today;
and it seems now as if it would be very trying to attend those
which had been already notified for the three following days;
still, I hope my mind will get a little settled by tomorrow.

My way leads towards Dublin,
where I had expected to arrive on the third or fourth of next week.
My health is good, only as this day`'s mental excitement has produced some headache,
which I hope a good night`'s rest will relieve.
I came from Liverpool by a steam-vessel to Belfast, where we landed five days ago,
and had a very fine passage.
We did not come to Ireland quite as soon as I had contemplated;
but I apprehend my stay will not be very long.
I have as yet found an open door here; the meetings have mostly been much favored.

On seventh day, the 29th, we had a favored and open meeting at Lurgan,
and on first day morning at Richill,
in which ability was given to exalt the kingdom of
Christ above that of the prince of darkness.
In the evening, at Moyallen, long silent and painful;
when I thought the time had nearly come to conclude the meeting, a few words sprung up,
altogether unexpectedly, with an impulse to repeat them in the meeting; which done,
others came, and so, from less to more, the opening increased,
and a searching time ensued among them; the trumpet of alarm was sounded,
and a preparation for a readiness to receive the last messenger, was closely recommended.

On second day we had a large meeting at Grange, near Charlemont,
where the doctrine of the fall, and the means of redemption, were largely set forth.
This is, I think, the largest country meeting I have met with in Europe.
After this meeting I returned with my dear friend, James N. Richardson,
who had been with me for the last few days, to his house, and tarried there several days,
being considerably indisposed.

On seventh day, the 6th of 10th mo.
travelled by coach seventy-two Irish miles, to Dublin,
with J. N. Richardson for my companion.
Here, next day, I attended their fore and afternoon meetings, which were solid seasons,
especially the last.
On second day we travelled sixty-three miles in the same way, to Enniscorthy,
and with us also in the coach was our friend Sarah White, a minister of Dublin.
Next day, attended their Monthly Meeting here, which was a favored, open time.
From Enniscorthy, we went the same evening, with the same friends,
J+++.+++ N. R. and S. W. to Forest, where, next day,
we had a meeting to the searching of some hearts;
in which also S. W. appeared acceptably, both in testimony and supplication.

After this we went to Ross, and had a public meeting there--open and favored.
Here we lodged at Samuel Elly`'s, who went with us next morning to Waterford,
where we attended their mid-week meeting; large, but long silent and laborious;
and never, to my recollection, did I feel more empty of any good thing;
but after the meeting had been sitting nearly the usual time, my way was opened,
and I had a close soul-searching testimony among them,
wherein some present were told the danger of their standing,
and I believe their ground was shaken.

We took tea at evening with an ancient Friend by the name of Mary Watson,
a niece of Samuel Fothergill.
She has long been an honest and eminent laborer in the service of the gospel.
She told me that when she went to meeting that day,
she was very desirous that the stranger might be favored
to get down to a clear sight of their condition;
and now she rejoiced that her desire had been realized; adding,
that on several such occasions of late,
the preaching had appeared to her to have been too much on the surface of things.

On sixth day I travelled to Youghall, and had a meeting there the same evening;
in which those present were exhorted to "`prove all things and
to hold fast that which is good;`" and in the course of my testimony,
I came to the passage,
thy days are numbered--thou art weighed in the balance and
found wanting;`" and I hope it proved a profitable meeting.
Here I lodged at Abram Fisher`'s. Next day, travelled about thirty Irish miles to Cork,
where on the first of the week, I attended their morning meeting,
which proved a truly interesting time;
and feeling a concern to have a meeting with the town`'s-people,
it was held at six o`'clock in the evening.
I was extensively engaged among them in support of
the doctrine of Christ`'s outward coming,
his character, offices, and sacrifice for sin,
as well as of his inward and spiritual appearance.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

I am much engaged at present, with company staying at our house and several other ways,
but I am not willing to omit sending thee a line, though brief,
expressive of my continued affectionate remembrance of thee,
and sympathetic feeling in this sorrowful event that is permitted thee in the
removal of thy dear daughter.--It is a sore trial to those that are left;
I know what it is; but for the dear objects of our love,
when we have hope that all is well with them,
we cannot mourn their removal from a world in which even the best
and most prosperous have many bitter cups to drink of.
I crave that thou may be supported under this sharp trial, whenever I think of thee,
which is often, and thy dear wife also.

I carefully transcribed thy manuscript while G. C. was with thee, and Thos.
Robson has read, and thinks well of it; and it has been revised again by my husband,
and I expect will be in the press, a part of it at least, by the middle of the week.

I have had the children very poorly, but they are better now, and I have a cold myself,
but my mind is very well,
and resolute in carrying forward the publication of these letters,
believing the very fulness of time is come for something of the kind to be given forth,
for the comfort and encouragement of many faithful Friends,
the strengthening of the weak and wavering, and the instruction of the ignorant;
and I am satisfied in that it has, in any degree,
fallen to our lot to assist in raising again the ancient standard of Truth in this country,
where Geo.
Fox so faithfully labored; and that which it will expose us to,
from loose and careless professors,
we are willing to bear for Jesus Christ`'s sake.--And now, I believe,
I must bid thee farewell, and in a near feeling of love and unity,
remain thy affectionate friend,

On second day, we travelled fifty miles to Limerick,
and next day attended their Monthly Meeting, to much satisfaction.
On fourth day, we went to Clonmel, and lodged at our ancient friend Sarah Grubb`'s,
at a hamlet called Anner Mills; she is an elder worthy of double honor.
On the next day, we attended their mid-week meeting,
and in it some close counsel was offered to a state of unfaithfulness.
Two dear Friends bore witness to the appropriateness of such counsel.
On the same afternoon,
I visited the school formerly established and endowed by Robert and Sarah Grubb,
and had a religious opportunity with the girls.

At Clonmel, I also met with a young minister by the name of Ann Moore,
and became more acquainted with her at the ensuing Quarterly Meeting at Waterford.
On sixth day evening, went to Waterford, in order to attend the Quarterly Meeting there;
where I was met, the same evening, by my dear friend Chas.
Osborn, he having crossed the Channel, this day, from Milford Haven, in Wales.
We were mutually glad to meet again.
On seventh day, 20th, attended the Select Quarterly Meeting,
which proved to be a strengthening time.

On first day, the 21st,
were held two meetings for worship for the Quarterly Meeting of Munster Province.
In the morning, the weight of public labor fell to my lot,
and my mouth was largely opened in declaring the gospel of life and salvation.
In the evening, my friend Charles Osborn was pretty large and lively in the ministry.
On second day,
the men and women Friends met separately to transact the business of the Society.
In that of the men I was silent,
but feeling an engagement to sit a little with the women, I had a precious,
open time with them, both in testimony and supplication.

On third day, they held another meeting for worship, as a parting opportunity,
in which many testimonies were borne, but I was silent,
although I had an opening pretty early in the meeting;
but there occurred so rapid a succession of offerings,
that I did not get forward to relieve my mind,
and so carried away something of a burden with me.
At the school meeting in the evening, which is a meeting for worship, and open to all,
I was exercised in imparting some counsel to parents, and had much peace in it.
Whilst here, I lodged at Joseph Strangman`'s,
and went several times to visit dear old Mary Watson, yet green and lively,
both in her conversation and ministry.

On fourth day morning, with C. O. and J. N. R. for company, I went by coach to Carlow,
where we had a meeting the same evening, and I had much close labor among them,
and C. O. not altogether silent.
On fifth day, we had a meeting at Kilconner, where the public service fell to C. Osborn.
After meeting, to Ballitore, where, next day, we had a meeting, open and favored, and,
in the evening, had a religious opportunity with the scholars, at their boarding-school.
Next day, parting with C. O. and J. N. R., who went directly to Dublin,
James Forbes came here and took me to his house, at a place called Christian Town,
and next day I attended their meeting at Rathangan, in which my service was extensive.

Next day, James Forbes bearing me company, we had a meeting at Edenderry,
and then at Moate, Killconner, and Mountmellick, which were all satisfactory,
and the states of the people, in measure, ministered to.
From Mountmellick, I went home with my companion, and, next day, to Dublin; and there,
on first day, the 4th of 11th mo., I again attended their large meeting,
and was livingly opened in testimony and supplication,
and led to pray that the little service done in this
nation might be as a nail in a sure place,
not to be moved.

Afternoon, I was at their meeting at Kingston, which seemed painful at first,
but ended well.
And now, on the 5th of 11th mo., feeling clear of Ireland,
and expecting to embark on board a steam-packet, at five o`'clock this evening,
for Liverpool; it seems proper for me to say, in conclusion of my visit to this nation,
that, during my service here,
it has been my lot to endure many inward and spiritual baptisms,
as a continual preparation for the service of the gospel in this part of the vineyard;
but the blessed Helper has been near, and prepared the way before me,
and has given me strength to labor (as I hope) with some degree of success;
and I trust that his name has not been dishonored thereby.
This, however, I must say, in humble thankfulness,
that a flow of sweet peace is my joyful, though unmerited portion;
and the language of my heart is, "`The kingdom, and the power, and the glory are thine!`"

At the house of Samuel Barclay, at Kingston, near Dublin harbor,
we had a solid parting opportunity with divers Friends;
and our spirits were baptized together into that feeling which hath no fellow,
and prayers were offered up for one another,
and our hearts were melted into contrition and great tenderness,
under the prospect that we should meet no more in this world.

We arrived safely in Liverpool the next morning, after a boisterous passage;
both C. Osborn and myself were very sea-sick.
This was on the 6th of 11th mo., and we stayed over their meeting on fifth day, the 8th,
where both were silent.
On sixth day, the 9th, with Ralph Neild for my companion, I set out for Yorkshire;
went to Manchester that night, and, next day, to Sheffield, where, on the day following,
which was first of the week, we attended their meetings; open,
and considerably enlarged in the morning, but silent in the afternoon.
Here I lodged again with my dear friend William Hargreaves,
under whose roof I felt very comfortable.

After the meetings at Sheffield, we lodged at Sarah Smith`'s, out of town,
and on third day, we had a good, open meeting at Doncaster,
where the gospel ran like a stream.
Afternoon, went to Ackworth, where, the day following, we sat with them in their meeting;
which, though long silent, as to myself, was, in the end, a favored meeting.
In this meeting,
the governess of the girls`' school was favored to bear a precious testimony,
in the life and power of Truth.
From hence, after parting with this interesting family, we went to Leeds, where,
on the evening of the 15th, we had a meeting, much to my relief.

My Beloved Wife And Children,

One week ago today, in company with my dear friend C. Osborne,
I arrived at Liverpool from Ireland, and on the next day, I wrote to our son A. C. W.,
and after it was too late to write by the packet
on the 8th thy acceptable letter of 10th mo.
4th, directed to me at Dublin came to hand, having lain in Liverpool,
enclosed in a parcel, for ten days; by some mistake failing to be forwarded.
I directed A. to transmit to thee the substance of mine to him,
by which I suppose thou will have become acquainted ere thou receive this,
of my return from Ireland, health, etc.

But still it may be some consolation for me to say in this,
that in the exercise of my gospel labors there,
the blessed Helper was mercifully very near to give strength to do his own work,
far beyond what I had a right to expect through so weak an instrument;
and I was enabled to leave that field of labor in great quietness and peace;
by which I have reason to hope that my work in that nation is done.

On sixth day morning last I left C. O. at Liverpool and went directly
to the residence of my friend Ralph Neild at Warrington,
who now joined me as companion, and we went to Manchester the same night,
and on seventh day to Sheffield to William Hargreaves, whose daughter Lydia,
a minister well beloved, desires her dear love to thee;
and having lost her only sister since I was last there,
she seems to know how to sympathize with us in our afflictions.

We stayed there two meetings, and yesterday went to Doncaster,
and last evening visited Martha Smith, a very valuable minister now in declining health;
and in a little solid season with her,
after I had spoken of the happy union of the disciples of Christ,
she poured forth a solacing testimony of love and fellow-feeling with me,
in the most endearing manner;
and also of her sympathy with thee and the children in my absence;
and expressed prophetically her belief that she saw in the openings
of light that I should be again restored to you in peace,
which to me were precious expressions.

We had a meeting there this morning, very open and precious,
and arrived here about four o`'clock,
where Robert Whitaker and wife bade us a hearty welcome.
We expect to attend meeting here tomorrow,
and on fifth day to go to Leeds and have a meeting there, then to York on sixth day,
and thus to finish with Yorkshire;
to a few places within which I have had many times to look back since I was here before.

On second day we expect to go directly into Lincolnshire and so enter on a visit to
the five remaining counties on that side of England containing about forty meetings;
but as they lie pretty scattering will probably occupy
me till some time in the first month,
when if well, I expect to go up to London,
and attend some meetings again there and in the county of Middlesex, during the winter,
and be ready, if Providence permit, to embark early in the spring;
and if blessed with the incomes of peace which,
in connection with the honor of the good Name is most of all to be desired,
will be a joyful day to me, probably as much so as any that I have ever experienced;
and towards which I dare not presumingly look,
knowing that all things yet to come are in the hands of the Great Disposer of events.

--

A disposition is making its appearance in divers places in this nation,
and among Friends, to think very little of the cross of Christ, practically,
and to plead for liberality, both of faith and practice;
the perceptible influence of the Holy Spirit is mournfully
deprecated by many members of our Society;
some of them in conspicuous standing,
are now disposed to put the Scriptures in the place of the Spirit,
and seem ready to hold them as the only rule of faith and practice,
or guidance of Christians.

This dereliction from principle,
and innovation upon the always acknowledged doctrine of our Society,
must have originated in the insidious wiles of the enemy,--a want of experience,
and of the true knowledge of God through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ;
and by having their minds darkened through disobedience and unbelief
in the true shining of the everlasting light and gospel of Christ;
thus becoming disposed to throw off and reject the needful restraints of it; and,
notwithstanding they fully acknowledge the propitiatory sacrifice,
with its blessed effects for the remission of sins, and place great dependence upon it,
yet, at the same time, Christ crucified, is to them, as to the Jews and Greeks formerly,
to the one a stumbling-block, and to the other, foolishness.

And there is much reason to fear that these wise and learned professors under our name,
who seem disposed to look down rather contemptuously upon the old sort of Friends,
are designing to bring about a change,
in some of the prominent and essential doctrines
of our Society,--such as the ministry and worship;
than which there can hardly be any two named,
subordinate to that of faith in God and in the Lord Jesus Christ,
which are more essential to the preservation and support of our religious compact.

It is very evident, that if we should come to believe that the Scriptures, of themselves,
are a sufficient guide in all the walks of a Christian life, then our silent,
spiritual worship will ere long, sink into disuse,
and our faith in the immediate renewing of the Divine Spirit,
on every occasion of the ministry, will be exploded.
This result is a consequence that must unavoidably
follow such a faith concerning the Holy Scriptures,
however excellent they are, in subordination to the Spirit which gave them forth.

From Leeds, I went to Rawden, and on the 17th of 11th month we went to York,
and next day, the first of the week, attended meetings there, but I was silent in both.
Here I rested one day; and called to take leave of many of our dear friends,
among whom were William and Ann Alexander, Hannah Murray, etc.

On third day morning, the 20th, we went to Thorne, and had an evening meeting there,
which was open and good, and next day to Gainsborough, in Lincolnshire,
where next morning, we had an open, favored meeting,
in which humility and meekness were spoken of,
as being prominent traits in the Christian character.
The same afternoon, we set out for Broughton,
and travelled about twenty miles to Lincoln, an ancient city,
and the metropolis of the county.
Here we had an interview with a few not of our Society,
but who meet together on the first day of the week, at one of their houses,
in the manner of Friends; and, with these,
we had a little meeting in our room at the inn;
towards whom counsel and encouragement were extended.

Next day, the 23rd, we arrived at Broughton, and had an open, weighty meeting,
in which the persuasive language of invitation flowed freely.
The day following we travelled twenty-eight miles to Boston,
and the next day had a meeting there for them, and for Leak and Wainfleet,
three small meetings together; the members whereof nearly all attended.
On the day preceding, and through the night and this morning,
my mind had been greatly exercised and bowed down before the Lord,
under a sense of my own great weakness and frailty;
being almost ready to fear that the mercies of the Lord were entirely taken from me;
but after sitting in this meeting for a considerable time, under the same weight,
my blessed Redeemer renewed in me again the word of life,
and I felt to myself like one newly risen from the dead;
and to my own astonishment a trumpet of alarm was given me to sound among those gathered,
I believe, to the awakening of many minds.

After this meeting, we went to Spalding, and lodged at William Massey`'s,
where I received comfortable letters from several friends in England.
Here next day I had an interesting meeting with Friends and a few Methodists,
and in it was much opened on the subject of Divine knowledge,
and the several means by which it was revealed to the children of men,
together with some remarks upon sanctification, and the baptism of the spirit.

Next we proceeded to Gedney,
and lodged at the house of our valued friend Jonathan Hutchinson.
Here we had a meeting on the day following,
in which I had much to say on the obligation that rests upon us,
to the support of our peculiar doctrines as a people.
On fourth day the 28th, in company with J. H. and daughter, we went to Wisbeach,
and next day, had a meeting with the few Friends there,
in which it appeared to me that my lot was to be silent.
They were not, however, without several attempts from others.

After this we went to March in Cambridgeshire, and had a meeting the same evening,
in which the people were reminded of the necessity of knowing our infirmities,
and of asking and receiving a portion of the divine Spirit,
whereby these infirmities are helped, and we are enabled to cease from doing evil,
and to learn to do well.
It was an open, good meeting,
though most of those present were not members of our Society.

Next day, the 30th, we went to Downham,
where the day following we had a meeting with the few friends living there,
and it was a close, searching time, for it seemed as if religion was at a low ebb here.
The same afternoon we went to Lynn,
and lodged at James and Cordelia Bayes`'s where next day, the first of the week,
and 2nd of 12th month we had a meeting, first with Friends and such as usually attend,
and in the evening with others.
Both of these were solid, interesting meetings,
in which the presence of the Ancient of Days was mercifully felt to be with us,
and overshadowed us in rather a remarkable manner, especially in the evening;
and I believe there is a seed sown here that will
take root downward and shoot forth upward,
and will be gathered to the elect and chosen of the Lord.

We went next to Wells, and on the 4th, sat with the little number there,
to whom the gospel was preached; and then we went to Holt,
where we had an evening meeting with a few friendly people,
to whom the language of encouragement flowed freely;
and here also I was persuaded of a little living seed, sown in the hearts of some,
and trust that this seed was watered from the living fountain,
and thereby refreshed and strengthened.

Next morning, we went to North Walsham, and sat with a few who compose a meeting there,
in which I was not able to feel anything of the heavenly dew or rain for a long time.
But at length way seemed to open to put to them an inquiry of what the cause might be,
that the heavens were thus shut up, and such a famine prevailed in their land;
and from a little, my testimony increased to more,
and I hope the opportunity turned to some profit.
After this meeting, we had another at Lammas, which, at last,
proved a pretty good meeting.
Here we lodged at John Wright`'s, whose son went with us next morning to Norwich;
and we attended their mid-week meeting,
where there was no want of preaching,--and I sat in silence.

After meeting, we went to Grove, where lives Jane Gurney,
the mother of Hannah C. Backhouse, now with her husband, Jonathan Backhouse,
on a religious visit in America.
Here we found three of their children, with whom, and their grandmother,
I felt much sympathy.
On sixth day, we had a meeting at Tasburg, to good satisfaction,
and returned the same evening to Grove.
On first day morning, I was much enlarged in their meeting at Norwich,
on the means of Christian redemption,
and the imperative necessity of man`'s cooperating therewith.

In the afternoon meeting, I was again silent, but there was no lack of preaching.
On second day, the 10th, we went to Wymondham.
In this meeting, a busy spirit made its appearance, by one not belonging here,
to which some caution was administered,
and Friends were invited to that quietness and stillness in which God is to be known.
Afternoon, we went to Attleborough,
and Thomas and Marianne Bayes (at whose house we dined) went with us;
and here we had a renewing time with the very few Friends belonging thereto,
who were feelingly called upon to diligence and earnestness
in the important concern of their soul`'s salvation.

After this, we went to Harling, and next day attended their meeting,
in which a renewed call and invitation was extended to those present,
and especially to the young men, of whom there was a considerable number.
From hence we went to Tivetshall, and had an evening meeting there,
in which the union between Christ and his church, and between the members of the body,
was described.
On fourth day, we travelled 34 miles to Yarmouth, and next day, had a heavenly,
baptizing meeting there.
In the evening, we had a meeting at Pakefield,
consisting mostly of the Episcopal order of people,
and the reality and substance of religion was exalted above the form.

On sixth day, the 14th of 12th mo., we went to Leiston, and had a meeting there,
in which the trumpet of alarm was at length sounded, calling to righteousness,
and to a labor in the garden of the Lord; and next day, went to Woodbridge, where,
on the first of the week, we were at their morning meeting,
in which the universality of divine grace, and the power of it,
were declared and supported.
In the evening, we had a meeting at Ipswich,
in which our public labors were extensive and arduous,
being testimony to the great necessity of humility and meekness,
and a call was also extended to the wandering prodigal.
Here we lodged with Dykes Alexander.
Next day, we went to Sudbury, and had an evening meeting with Friends,
to good satisfaction; and here we stayed awhile and wrote.

Crownthorpe, 12th mo., 16th, 1832.

[.salutation]
Esteemed And Dear Friend,

Thy kind invitation to me to address a few lines to thee before thou left England,
I feel at this time some degree of liberty to accept,
for when we are made sensible of how good and how pleasant
it is for brethren to dwell together in unity,
we are also at times encouraged and strengthened by remembering
that the precious ointment upon the head,
that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron`'s beard,
went down to the skirts of the garments,
even as the pure love of the gospel flows from the fathers to the children,
from the greatest to the least,
uniting in one bond of discipleship those who love
the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity and desire,
above all things,
to be made partakers of that full and free salvation which is in him alone.

But ah, my dear friend,
how often does nature shrink from the many bitter cups and deep baptisms by and
through which we must become prepared to be partakers of this salvation;
and if we truly desire to attain unto it--if we sincerely desire to endure unto the end,
how needful do I feel it to be to wait in daily retirement and
stillness before Him who only can renew our spiritual strength,
who alone can enlighten our path and uphold our feet, that they stumble not in the way.

Thy caution to me, concerning my beloved child,
answered to the counsel of the witness in my own heart;
it is no light matter to know our affection for these precious charges to be
brought into and kept under subjection to the love of Him who hath said,
"`Whoso loveth son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me;`"
but my supplication is, that I may attain unto this,
so that whatever may seem good unto Divine wisdom, the language of my soul may be,
in truth, "`Not my will, but thine be done,`"
believing that it is in this entire resignation of our own will,
that we are kept in safety, and permitted to taste of peace.

I believe I may acknowledge, dear friend,
that thy late visit to us was to edification and
to comfort;--it is sweet and pleasant to our remembrance,
(I speak for my dear husband as well as for myself.) and our united desire for thee is,
that He who we believe has put thee forth, and who has also, we believe,
gone before thee, may mercifully restore thee to the bosom of thy family in peace;
and though it may not be given unto thy eye to see of the travail of thy soul,
yet Mayest thou be permitted to rely in faith on the promise that the
word that goeth forth out of his mouth shall not return unto Him void,
but it shall accomplish that which He pleased,
and prosper in the thing whereto he sent it.
In the love of the gospel, we bid thee, dear friend, most affectionately, farewell,
and remain thy friends,

[.signed-section-signature]
Thos.
And Marianne Bayes.

On fourth day, the 19th, we took public coach and went to London,
lodging again at Peter Bedford`'s. On fifth day, went to Newington,
and attended their mid-week meeting,
in which the love of our heavenly Father was sweetly felt,
in our silent sitting before Him, and was afterwards spoken of,
and all were invited to come, taste, and see how good the Lord is;
and my dear friend William Allen, corroborated the same.
After meeting, I spent a little time with my valued friends, John and Sarah Grubb,
and made one or two other calls, and then went to William Allen`'s, where I lodged,
and next morning, had religious opportunities at the girls`' school at Newington,
and with the widow of Frederick Janson, in which I thought good help was afforded.

The same evening, I went to Tottenham, and spent the night with my dear, aged friend,
Thomas Shillitoe, where I met with Daniel Wheeler, for the first time, and next day,
made several social visits, and returned again to London.
Next morning, the first of the week, I was at Devonshire House,
and the meeting was pretty open and good,
in which dear Ann Jones followed me in testimony very acceptably.
Afternoon, at Grace-Church Street, where we had a painful, heavy meeting,
and although I had considerable labor therein, and some very close remarks,
yet it did not afford so much peace and comfort as at other times; and I felt confirmed,
that there were some dark, hard minds present.

On second day, came on the Select Quarterly Meeting for London and Middlesex,
which was large; but silence was my lot.
My dear friend Ann Jones was enabled to make some interesting and pertinent remarks,
very applicable to the state of our Society, in this land, at the present day.
On third day, was their public Quarterly Meeting--very full and large.
Dear Ann Jones was exercised in solemn supplication,
and William Allen and Daniel Wheeler, in testimony, acceptably; but, as for me,
I sat silently, under a sorrowful sense of the state of things in this land;
for it is clearly to be felt and seen, that among this people under our name,
there are two armies arrayed, army against army,
lifting up their weapons one against the other;
and great struggles are plainly to be felt and seen,
by those whose eyes are happily anointed by the finger of Jesus.

It is seen, also, that instead of "`one Lord, one faith,
and one baptism,`" there is a diversity of faith,
as it regards the ministration of Him who is one, by his holy, spiritual baptism,
and as to the worship of the true tabernacle.
And it is greatly to be feared that this strife will
not always be kept within the secret chamber,
and subdued, without the exposure of Antichrist and his kingdom,
and without a storm of the elements in which he worketh.
And much commotion, and thunderings, and lightnings,
and earthquakes will be seen and heard in divers places;
and the tabernacle of those who have slidden from the sure foundation, the Rock of Ages,
however lofty and beautiful to look upon, will be thrown down,
and removed out of the way, and their place will be known no more,
in the heritage of the Lord`'s spiritual Israel.

Having frequently, since our visit to Norwich,
felt some drawings in my mind to return thither again, I have, of late,
thought best to attend their ensuing Quarterly Meeting; in order for which,
after the Quarterly Meeting in London,
I took the mail stage at 8 o`'clock the same evening,
in company with Daniel Wheeler and Ralph Neild, and travelled all night, 118 miles,
and arrived at Norwich next morning about 9 o`'clock; and, the following evening,
attended their Select Quarterly Meeting, in which I was led into considerable labor,
on our doctrine concerning spiritual worship and the ministry,
and had great peace therein.

Next day, the 27th, I attended their Quarterly Meeting at large;
but there seemed to be no room allowed for me to
unburden myself of that which I had borne many days.
On the opening of this meeting,
my dear friend Daniel Wheeler was well exercised in a short testimony; after which,
other offerings were made in such rapid succession,
that I was obliged to sit silent throughout;
but felt a strong engagement to appoint a meeting next morning,
and to desire Friends to attend it, before their return home;
and accordingly the appointment was made, and Friends generally attended.
In this meeting,
my concern and engagement led me to illustrate some of the fundamental
doctrines of Christianity--the different manifestations and attributes
of the Deity--the doctrine of sanctification and justification, etc.
The blessed Truth was near to help, and the victory was mercifully and signally obtained.

After I sat down, E. F., a prominent minister arose,
apparently with the intention of sustaining their preaching here;
and first acknowledging that God had been with us that day,
proceeded to refer to the apostle`'s expression, "`there are divers gifts,
but all by the same spirit;`" and, in her weakness,
disclosed an intention of spreading the idea over the meeting,
that though there might seem a difference in the
various appearances in that Quarterly Meeting,
yet that they were virtually the same.

I had been greatly burdened with a superficial, busy spirit, which seems to prevail here,
both in meetings and in families.
The busy working of this spirit, the dread of conflict,
and the shunning of the cross of Christ,
with a love for the friendship of the world and its greatness, have led to a loss,
which I fear is irreparable; and, moreover,
some unsound doctrines appear to have crept in;--such as the belief that
we are elected and justified before we are purified and sanctified;
and a trusting in a mere imputed righteousness for salvation,
without regard to obedience, and those works which are wrought in God,
through the constraining and sanctifying influence of his spirit.

I was grieved at the usage I met with here, which, I thought, was almost uncivil.
A stranger from a foreign land had sacrificed all for a long time,
and come over the sea to relieve his mind of a burden which rested upon it,
and now had come all the way from London to attend this Quarterly Meeting,
yet the time was nearly all taken up therein, by such as might well be there at any time;
and so I was led to appoint a meeting,
for the express purpose of relieving my own mind,--then, that they should subjoin,
with a design to give a levelling cast at my dearly-bought testimony among them, did,
to me, appear dishonorable, if not unchristian and uncivil.
Yet, to satisfy and mend everything with me personally,
they were not entirely wanting in a fawning disposition,
and a professed love and friendship for me.

But, to do justice to some dear friends here,
I feel bound to say that they received me and my testimony,
in the fellowship and ownings of the gospel of Christ;
and these did bear up and strengthen my hands; and my desire and prayer to God for them,
is that he may be very near, and sustain them through all afflictions,
amid those bonds which encompass them.
And now, I left Norwich very peacefully,
believing that I had discharged all that was required of me.
Daniel Wheeler`'s company and united labors were very acceptable to me,
during the short time we were together laboring in the fellowship of the gospel.

He has been residing for about fifteen years at Petersburg, in Russia,
but now recently obtained certificates from his own Monthly Meeting in Yorkshire,
England, to make an extensive visit, in religious service,
to some of the South Sea Islands and New Holland,
which will probably take several years to accomplish.
I left him at Norwich.
I also parted there with my dear friend and kind companion, Ralph Neild,
from whence he returned home.
His company and service had been truly acceptable to me, he being an honest, sincere man,
of quick perceptions and discernment in regard to the state of meetings,
as well as of individuals.

On seventh day, the 29th, in company with Benjamin Holmes, went to Bury, forty-two miles,
and, next day, met with Friends in the morning,
and had a meeting in the evening with the town`'s-people;
in both which I was largely engaged in declaring the word of life,
revealed in the gospel.

[.salutation]
My Beloved Wife,

Not feeling clear of Norwich, we returned thither again from London on third day night.
We left London the evening of their Quarterly Meeting,
and reached Norwich the next morning;
where our kind friend Jane Gurney received us very affectionately.
Their Select Meeting took place the following evening,
and their Quarterly Meeting the next morning; in the former I had good service,
but in the latter there was not room in the midst of so many offerings;
and I felt grieved--a stranger here,
and having now come so far to attend the Quarterly Meeting,
and no opportunity afforded to throw off my burden.

I had attended three meetings when here before, and could open my mind in but one.
Hence, it seemed best to appoint a meeting,
in the hope that they would allow time for a poor exercised stranger to relieve his mind.
Accordingly, a meeting was appointed for the next day;
and most of the Friends who attended the Quarterly Meeting stayed and attended it;
and it was a very interesting time, wherein Truth was made to prevail,
and many hearts to rejoice.

I met with a Friend at Tottenham by the name of Daniel Wheeler,
whose residence for about fifteen years has been at Petersburg, in Russia,
but is still a member of a Monthly Meeting in Yorkshire.
He has obtained certificates to visit many of the Islands in the Pacific Ocean,
and Van Diemen`'s Land, in which voyage he will circumnavigate the globe.
He had been very desirous of seeing me, and, on our meeting,
he pretty soon let me know that he had some view of Norwich in conjunction with me,
and finding that I was now bound thither, he readily agreed to bear me company;
and accordingly, went and joined in religious service there.

He is truly an interesting character,
and stands upon the primitive foundation of Quakerism and
genuine Christianity--a man of sound and clear mind,
stored with the meekness of the gospel.
He went to Russia by the request of the Emperor Alexander,
to drain morasses and boggy land, in which business he has been ever since employed;
and now his eldest son has taken his place.
His wife is also left there, and three other children.
Friends have nearly concluded to purchase a small
vessel exclusively for his voyage and accommodation,
and to man her for the purpose.

He will probably be gone five or six years.
I left him at Norwich this morning, but expect to meet with him again in London,
when I return there.
It was spoken of in the Select Meeting at Norwich as being very
interesting to have the company of two Friends from such different
and remote places upon the earth.--In much tender love to thee,
my dear wife, and to all our children, relations, and friends,
and desiring that our good and gracious Helper would keep, instruct, and bless you,

[.signed-section-closing]
I am thine,

Here, my friend John King, of Sudbury, met me, in order to bear me company for a time;
and, on second day, the 31st, we travelled to Godmanchester, near Huntingdon,
forty-two miles, and had a meeting with Friends there the same evening, though open,
yet plain in doctrine to some present.

On the 1st of 1st mo., 1833, I went to St, Ives, and attended the Monthly Meeting there,
long silent; but a living call was at length extended,
and an invitation to gather to God and to Christ, the life and the power.
We went, that evening, to Earith, and lodged at John Brown`'s; on the following day,
had a meeting with Friends there, and the same evening one at Chatteris,--the first,
open, the last, close, searching, and alarming.
The day following, we had a meeting with Friends at Sutton, mostly with young people,
to whom caution and counsel went forth freely, warning them to avoid high-mindedness,
and the love of the world.
After this,
we returned with John Brown to his own house and spent some time with Sarah Squire,
a valuable minister, at her brother`'s,
where we had a religious opportunity that evening,
in which some exhortation went forth in love, to the young people present; and,
next morning, in a solid, parting opportunity,
S+++.+++ S. was exercised in prayer for our preservation,
and I had a few words of encouragement to my elderly friends,
to hold fast the profession of their faith in God, to the end;
and to their precious daughter, Mary Brown, was subjoined a call to some service,
rather peculiar.

I have now gone over this land of Great Britain and Ireland,
and attended nearly all the meetings as I went, throughout both countries;
and I begin to feel as if my service here was nearly accomplished,
and think to go pretty directly to London, in order to inform the Morning Meeting there,
of the accomplishment of my services in this land, (or, as I trust,
nearly so,) and to obtain from them a returning certificate,
directed to my friends in America, if, indeed,
that meeting shall have approved of my labors here.
Howbeit, I apprehend I have some service yet unfinished, in London and Middlesex.

On sixth day, the 4th of 1st mo., we set out for London,
and travelled as far as Ampthill,
lodging again with my beloved friends Samuel and Ann May,
who received us very affectionately.
On first day, the 6th, attended their meeting in the morning,
and had a meeting in the evening with the town`'s-people,--both open times.
On second day, I went to Hitchin, and the same evening had a meeting there,
when the states of some present were opened and spoken to.
Next day went to Hertford,
and the day following attended their weekday meeting,--long silent, but open at last.

From hence we went to Tottenham, and lodged again at Robert Forster`'s. Here,
on fifth day, we attended their Monthly Meeting,
in which heavenly wisdom was distinguished from man`'s wisdom, and set above it.
On sixth day, the 11th of 1st mo., I went to London, to my old home at Peter Bedford`'s,
and rested and wrote, having travelled, since leaving Dublin,
one thousand and thirty-seven miles.
On first day, the 13th, I was at Peel Meeting,
and in the evening at Westminster,--both open, though the latter long silent;
and for a time after I stood up,
it seemed difficult to find an entrance into the minds of those to whom my service belonged;
but the point was, in good measure, gained at last.

On second day, the 14th, I attended the Morning Meeting,
composed of all the ministers and elders in the nation,
but seldom attended by many from without the Quarterly Meeting of London and Middlesex.
I now informed the meeting that I apprehended my services in this land were nearly accomplished,
and was induced, by the peace and quietude of mind, which, through unmerited mercy,
I now felt, to hope that my labors, however few and imperfect,
were accepted for what was required of me;
and acknowledging the great kindness of friends,
and their readiness to assist me in the performance of my
engagements during the time of my being amongst them,
now desired them to certify to my friends at home, if it were so,
that my services had been accepted by my friends here,
as I now had a prospect of returning shortly to America.
Divers present expressing much unity with me and with my labors,
a committee was appointed to prepare a certificate, and to present it at the adjournment,
that day week.

On third day, the 15th, I went to Southwark Monthly Meeting,
where I had much labor in the opening and liberty of the gospel.
My former companion, Daniel P. Hack, having come up to London, from Brighton,
his place of residence,
and desiring that I would go with him thither to spend a little time,
I having now a few days leisure did so; and on fourth day, the 16th, we went to Crawley,
and lodged at John Robinson`'s, whose son John was desiring to go with me to America;
which being agreed on, we went next day to Brighton;
and I was truly glad to meet with divers dear friends there.

On sixth day was their Monthly Meeting, in which I had good open service.
On seventh day, returned again to London, and on first day morning, the 20th,
accompanied by my friend Peter Bedford, I attended their Morning Meeting at Peckham,
in which we were favored with the flowing of the gospel; and, returning to London,
attended a meeting at Grace-Church Street, appointed by our beloved friend Sarah Grubb,
in which she had good service.
On second day, I attended the adjournment of the Morning Meeting, at Devonshire House,
where a returning certificate was brought in for me and approved, being satisfactory.

On third day, I went to Newington,
and spent a day or two with my dear friends John and Sarah Grubb, both ministers,
and she an eminent instrument in the Lord`'s hand in the
promulgation of the ancient doctrines of the gospel.
With these friends I felt my spirit nearly united,
and we had much interesting conversation in the freedom and liberty of the Truth.
On fourth day evening, went to the house of William Allen,
who was now about to go to the continent, to join Stephen Grellet,
on a visit into Spain,--an adventure which I think has never been made before by Friends,
and is thought to be a perilous undertaking.
I felt my mind very nearly united with this my dear friend William Allen,
and we had some interesting conversation on the state of the Society in England.

On fifth day, the 24th, I went to Tottenham and attended their mid-week meeting,
which I think was a solid time.
Staying a day or two here,
I made a number of social visits to divers friends for the last time,
and taking leave of them in a solemn manner,
went back to Newington on seventh day everting, and then went into the city;
and next morning, the 27th, went to Grace-Church Street meeting, which was an open,
favored, searching time.
At six o`'clock in the evening, had a meeting in Devonshire House, for Friends generally,
in London, (except Southwark,) as a final parting opportunity;
and I trust it was a solemn time to many,
in which I took leave of them in the love and fellowship of the gospel,
commending them to God, and to the word of his grace.

On second day,
I had an interview and conference with several prominent characters of the Society,
on our doctrine and testimonies.
On third day, the 29th, in company with Peter Bedford, I left London,
and went on my way rejoicing, whilst my heart was filled with this language: "`Farewell,
farewell,
to this great city! peace be within thy walls and prosperity within thy palaces!`"
I had, first and last, spent about two months in and about London,
had labored diligently, and had endured many deep baptisms and close trials; but now,
in the end, found peace as a canopy to cover my mind, to the rejoicing of my heart;
and I praised the Lord.

We arrived in time, at the house of Richard and Mary Fell, at Uxbridge, where we lodged,
and P. B. returning next morning to London, I went to their mid-week meeting,
in which I had a good open time; and in the evening came my young friend Gilbert Jilkes,
from London, (nephew to P. B.,) in order to accompany me to Worcester,
for which place we took coach next morning, and arrived there, at Henry Newman`'s,
about nine in the evening--one hundred miles.
Here, next day, I had a meeting again with Friends,
and was much enlarged in an impressive and close testimony, and left in great peace.
I parted here with Gilbert Jilkes, and was met by Edward Southall, from Leominster,
with whom I went to his own house.
At Leominster I arrived on seventh day evening,
and on the next day attended the meeting of Friends in the morning,
and a public meeting in the evening, both good, open times.

On fourth day morning, I took coach for Liverpool, with E. S. for my companion,
and arrived there the same afternoon; and on fifth day, attended their mid-week meeting,
which was open and satisfactory; and next day we went to Warrington,
our friend Frances Thompson going with us.
On the day following, went by the way of Manchester to Stockport,
to the house of our dear friends George and Ann Jones,
where we met also with Elizabeth Robson and Abigail Dockray,
and I think it was a mutually pleasant meeting to us all.

Next day I returned to Manchester, to their morning meeting, in which,
through heavenly goodness, my mouth was opened, in the demonstration of the gospel,
which, I believe, was "`the savor of life unto life`" to some,
and "`the savor of death unto death`" to others; for in some here,
I apprehend too much reason to fear a lapse and departure
from our ancient doctrines and testimonies.
This is one of the largest meetings of Friends in England.
Their meetinghouse, lately erected, is far from according, in my apprehension,
with the simplicity of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

We returned to Stockport, and had a meeting there in the evening,
and lodged again with George and Ann Jones;
and next morning returned directly to Liverpool, by the railway,
in order to make preparations for my voyage to America,
having engaged a passage on board the packet-ship Hibernia, George Maxwell, master,
to sail on the 16th. On arriving at Liverpool, I went now to my dear friends`',
George and Margaret Crosfield`'s, in order to spend a few days with them,
which I did to much satisfaction, they being honest Friends,
and truly desirous of upholding the ancient doctrines and usages of the Society.

I had, during the last season,
written divers letters to this my friend and former companion,
on some subjects which rested with much weight upon my mind,
and which he had published in the 10th mo.
last; and now, as I was about leaving the nation,
and not knowing but a new edition might be called for,
it was thought best to reexamine them, and to make such revision as might appear useful,
which with the advice of several friends we accomplished.

On fifth day, the 14th, I attended again their mid-week meeting,
to which a general invitation of Friends and friendly people was previously given,
and it proved, as a parting opportunity, a truly solid time.
In my testimony,
way opened for a reference to my services and exercises generally in this land,
and to the sincerity in which I had labored in the Society here, though it had been,
as the Apostle expressed himself, in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling;
but now, in the conclusion,
my mind was mercifully filled and comforted with the reward of sweet peace.

The spirit of supplication was also vouchsafed at this solemn time,
and my mouth was opened in fervent prayer,
that the little service in which I had been engaged in this land,
might be as a nail in a sure place;
and a fervent petition was also lifted up to the unslumbering Shepherd of Israel,
that he would deign to keep and preserve the afflicted and lowly walkers in Zion,
and guide them in the way everlasting.
Sixth and seventh days were spent in visiting divers dear friends,
in preparing for my voyage,
and in writing to several friends in different parts of the kingdom,
bidding them a hearty farewell; and on seventh day evening,
a large number assembled at my lodgings at T. Thompson`'s,
where we had a comfortable opportunity, both social and religious;
wherein both heart and hand were lifted up for my preservation over the mighty deep,
and safe restoration to my dear family.

The next morning, which was first day, the 17th of 2nd mo.,
I was called upon to go on board the ship at 9 o`'clock, and so,
accompanied by E. Robson, G. Crosfield, Thos.
Thompson, Ralph Neild and a number of others, I went down and embarked;
and the ship soon got under way, with a fair wind from the S. E.,
and went round Holyhead that night, about 8 o`'clock.
The wind then shifting favorably to the N. W. and blowing fresh,
we went rapidly down St. George`'s Channel on second day; and on third day morning,
found ourselves fairly out to sea.
Wind again S. E. but very light; nevertheless, it increased all day, till night,
when it blew with great violence, and so continued all night.

The sea ran into mighty heaps, and the waves roared tremendously,
and seemed to threaten destruction to our ship, our sole dependence in this world; which,
in comparison of the mighty waters--now into tempest,
now into mountains wrought--seemed like a very little
thing--or as a mere nutshell on a spacious stream.
Now, by the power of fierce winds, ascending to the summit of a mighty wave;
then downward plunging with rapid speed,
as if towards the nether bounds of ocean`'s great abyss!
But still, in admiration seen, her buoyancy was such, that,
as though by the uplifting of Almighty power, she would rise again,
and mount the next succeeding swell--or partially, when the summit rolled too high,
and over us poured its briny floods, almost hiding us in its surge!

Within the compass of ten days, this severe storm was succeeded by three others,
of equal violence; indeed the last was thought rather to exceed the rest.
Capt.
Maxwell told me that he had not known such a time for a number of years.
But through mercy, these mighty gales were not of long duration,
none exceeding twenty-four hours.

During these severe gales, the ship`'s sails were all taken in,
and she was put in the posture of lying to, and so driving with the wind;
and she rolled about so exceedingly that all loose
articles were thrown into confusion and disorder.
One of the steerage passengers, by the heave of the ship,
was thrown down upon the edge of a box, whereby his arm was fractured very badly,
and the scarf or splinter of the bone, puncturing a small artery,
it was thought by the surgeon,
for some days that he was in much danger of losing his arm, if not his life;
but he is now, on the 14th of 3rd mo.
in a fair way to do well.

After these storms had subsided,
(during which we had apparently gained but a short distance from Cape
Clear in Ireland,) we had pretty fair wind and weather for some time,
and advanced very well, until second day morning, the 11th of 3rd mo., when at 4 o`'clock,
the ship was perceived to come in contact with some solid bodies,
which proved to be floating and scattered pieces of ice,
but not large in their dimensions.
No alteration was made, except to shorten sail,
so as to meet them with less violence (being on direct course), and so we continued,
until 9 o`'clock the same evening,
when we found ourselves entirely enclosed in a vast field of this material,
and so closely crowded together as entirely to obstruct our progress.

This was in latitude 45° north, and 48° west from London,
and not far short of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland.

Here we could see nothing but ice in any direction, except the way from whence we came.
But on the same afternoon, the seamen made shift to get the ship about,
and reverse our course, and so before night, we got into open sea again.
It was very unexpected by the Captain and crew,
thus to find floating ice in this region so early in the spring;
and the object now was to try to get so far south as to pass it on that side,
and then go on our way to the westward.
But the wind blowing from S. S. W. made it very slow
and tedious gaining ground in that direction.

However they beat to and fro as well as they could,
continuing their starboard tack until they began
to come in contact with the ice every time,
and then shifting sails, etc., until third day evening,
when the scattering ice appeared smaller and softer;
and now the Captain thought he could make his way through it,
the wind being nearly south, and pretty favorable for our course.
He made the attempt, but in the course of the evening,
found himself entirely brought to a stand again; for the ice, though softer,
was so thick, and crowded so closely together, that the ship, with all her canvas spread,
could no longer advance; so here we lay, quite still until fifth day morning, the 14th,
when they made out, by breaking away the ice, to get the ship about,
and to make some progress eastward, though hardly perceptible.

Whilst we were lying here, we discovered two large icebergs,
one of them about a mile to the south of us, and rising about forty feet above the water,
and thought to be about one mile in circumference.
The other was to the west, and being more distant, could not be so well described,
but some part of it was evidently much higher than the first.
Before we left this region we saw seven of these
icebergs in different directions from us,
and of different dimensions.

At evening the wind shifted to the N. W. and blew fresh,
whereby we were enabled to get clear of the ice at about ten this evening,
and so run off southerly until morning, and then took our course again,
and saw no more of the ice.
From which time until now, the 20th, the wind has been often unfavorable and light,
so that our progress has been rather slow; and by observation today,
find our latitude to be 41° 50`', and long.
63° 22`'. The 22nd, the wind ahead, making little or no progress.
The 23rd the wind N. W. advancing some, but slowly, until the 26th in the morning,
when we made land on the south side of Long Island; and about noon,
the pilot boat came down, and we took a pilot on board,
who beat us up near to the Narrows, where we let go anchor; and next morning, the 27th,
a steamboat came down from the city, and towed the ship up against the wind,
and we landed about 11 o`'clock.
It was cause of deep thankfulness that I was permitted
to set my feet once more upon this my native land.

I stayed two days at New York, and called on divers friends,
who rejoiced with me in the mercies of a kind Providence,
in thus sparing my life through many perils, both by sea and by land.
On the 29th I embarked on board a steam vessel, and landed next morning at New London,
the 30th of 3rd mo., 1833, and about noon the same day,
arrived safely at my own home at Hopkinton, and a time of mutual rejoicing I had,
with my dear wife and children,
and I trust that our hearts were filled with gratitude and thankfulness to the Lord,
for his favors and tender mercies, in thus restoring us to each other;
and I desire that we may never forget to praise his good and blessed name.

It appears, by my list of distances, that I travelled,
after landing in Liverpool until I sailed from thence again,
seven thousand eight hundred and fifty-seven miles;
and the two passages across the Atlantic, allowing for the zigzag courses,
would amount to, at least, seven thousand miles, so that the whole travel,
by sea and by land, would make over fourteen thousand eight hundred miles.
From a regular diary kept, it appears that I attended 348 of the regular,
established meetings in Great Britain and Ireland, and that,
by including an additional attendance of many of the same, and appointed public meetings,
it will amount to 114 more.
To this list might be added 90 meetings more,
consisting of the sittings of the yearly meeting,
and all the quarterly and monthly meetings and their select meetings,
the meeting for sufferings and the morning meeting in London, which I attended,
and the whole number will be 552.

I was gone from home one year, eight months and ten days,
but remained in the United Kingdom only one year and about six months, or 545 days,
so that, on an average, I attended a meeting for every day.

Gisborough, 5th of 1st mo., 1833.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

I expected to see thee again before thou took thy departure from us--indeed
I had some expectation of meeting thee at our Quarterly Meeting,
but dear Hannah Murray told me thou had`'st been there a few weeks previous,
and that thou wast likely to leave this land before long.
She also let me see thy letters to George Crosfield, which I read whilst under her roof,
and purchased several copies before I left York.
They were cordial to my mind, and I believe generally liked in Yorkshire.
They are very appropriate for the present day--something of this kind seemed wanting.
There are few who will be honest to their feelings,
or who dare to espouse a cause however good,
in opposition to the popular views of the great and learned ones amongst us.

I think, my dear friend, this is a service worth what it has cost thee,
if thou hadst had no other in this land than thus
to point out the safe path between two extremes,
to show us the good old way in which our worthy predecessors walked.
How precious is the remembrance of those valiant ones,
who turned not their backs in the day of battle,
but fought manfully under the banner of the Lamb,
"`in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation,
among whom they shone as lights in the world.`"

The time seems now arrived when the current of popular innovation should be checked,
or it might have carried away all before it,
and probably thou wast the instrument to cross the great deep to do it,
or at least open the way for it.
I hope thou wilt have solid peace and satisfaction in giving
up to what thou believed called for at thy hands.

And now my dear friend, I may tell thee, that,
after returning home from the Yearly Meeting,
and weighing in my mind what had occurred there,
I fell best satisfied to address a letter to two Friends,
with such variations as circumstances called for.
A copy of that to Anna Braithwaite, with her reply,
I took with me to York for thy perusal, had thou been there, and,
as opportunity now offers for private conveyance,
I mean to enclose my letter to her in this.
Perhaps A. B. would not like me to send a copy of hers,
which was not particularly relieving to my mind.
I think mine would be better not exposed,
but should`'st thou be at our mutually beloved friends`' at Croyden,
I have no objection to their seeing it, nor yet our interested friend Geo.
Crosfield, of Liverpool, to whom present my dear love.

A+++.+++ B. told us at the Yearly Meeting,
that we were to "`keep an even balance,`" but the scale
has long appeared to me to preponderate on the wrong side.
I can recollect the time, when the mercy of God in Christ Jesus,
in the glorious plan of our redemption, was too little adverted to,
but now the historical or outward belief of this,
appears to be held up and brought to view by some,
as if our salvation wholly depended on this belief, so frail are we,
and liable to run into extremes,
but we are hardly aware of the serious consequences
of giving the weight so much on one side,
as greatly to weaken the other.

There seems to me something plausible in it; much that favors our natural propensities,
as we know it is much easier to believe in what Christ
did and suffered for us in that prepared body,
than spiritually to "`know him, and the power of his resurrection,
and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death.`"
I think such views may exalt, not humble, the creature,
and also beget apathy and indifference in spiritual warfare.
The grand deceiver, who is never wanting in his insinuations, can, it is said,
transform himself into an angel of light, and if, by any means,
he can settle us at ease in our sins, his malignant purposes are fully answered.

If Christ, when personally upon earth, who knew the end from the beginning,
who spoke and taught as never man did, had, in his memorable sermon on the mount,
or in any of his divine exhortations to the people,
insisted that their mere belief or acknowledgment
of what he was about to accomplish for them,
"`through the eternal Spirit (in offering) himself without spot to God`" was more essential
to their salvation than the operation of his spirit and power within them,
by which they were washed, sanctified and justified in his name,
then we might have kept "`an even balance.`"
But the stress of Christ`'s doctrine runs thus, "`Repent,
for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.`"
"`Except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees,`" etc.
"`Marvel not that I said unto thee, ye must be born again.`"
"`Enter ye in at the straight gate,`" etc.

But I need not dwell longer on these things,
as I believe thou and I are of one heart and one mind.
We live in eventful days, and those of great excitement;
and never was there more occasion for the watchmen and watch-women to "`walk about Zion,
go round about her, to tell the towers thereof, mark ye well her bulwarks,
consider her palaces.`"
Truly it is well for those who know an establishment
and safe abiding on the immutable foundation,
Christ Jesus, the eternal Rock of Ages, for no other foundation can any man lay,
with safety, than that which is already laid;
but how greatly have we slidden from it into by-ways, and crooked paths,
in a dark and cloudy day of temptation.
How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed!

Many of us have gone back again into Egypt,
and some remain in the wilderness in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is.
It was never the design of the Almighty that we should be
a people thus robbed and spoiled of our ancient beauty,
and I see no other way in which the church can "`come up from the wilderness,
leaning upon her beloved`" but by chastisements.
It often appears to me as if we should, in this way, be visited;
the foundation of many amongst ourselves may be tried,
the chaff separated from the wheat, which is the weighty, substantial part.

"`The Lord knoweth them that are his,`" and those
he will hide in his pavilion in the time of trouble,
for I believe there will always remain a seed to serve him, which,
after passing through the fiery ordeal may survive these days of tribulation,
to whom the following portion of Scripture may be appropriate,
"`In that day shall the Lord of Hosts be for a crown of glory,
and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,`"--and again,
"`My people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and sure dwellings,
and in quiet resting places.`"
I am reminded, whilst writing on these subjects, to look well to my own standing.

I think I will engage, if life and faculties be spared, to deliver thy messages,
and also to write to thee in return,
and may the blessing of preservation be thine across the mighty deep.
Thou hast seen the Lord`'s wonders there, as well as on land,
and I have no doubt spiritually experienced "`the floods (to) have lifted up their voice;
the floods lift up their waves,`" but there is a voice speaketh louder than theirs,
whose command both winds and waves obey.

Many are the tribulations of the righteous,
but He whose promises are yea and amen forever, will deliver them out of them all.
A little more faith, my beloved friend, and a little more patience,
and then cometh the end,
and a blessed one it will be to those "`that do His commandments,
that they may have right to the tree of life,
and may enter in through the gates into the city.`"

With affectionate remembrance, thy sincere friend,

Mount Vernon, 1st mo., 8th, 1838.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend,

Thou art very often the companion of my thoughts which follow
thee in thy pilgrimage through this land,
closely sympathizing with thee in thy various trials, of which I have a strong feeling;
as much, I think, almost, as if I was outwardly a partaker of them with thee,
often desiring thy support under them, and many times comforted with the belief,
that thy strength is as thy day`'s work requires.
We had an acceptable letter from Ralph Neild since his return,
with many interesting particulars of your travels,--in
it I was glad to hear thou wast tolerably well,
and drawing near the end of thy work.

Thy journey into England has happened at a hard time for thee,
but Providence saw thou wast able, and has qualified thee for the work,
and I doubt not that many in this land will profit by thy labors,
and have already done so.
It has been the means of opening our eyes to things we did not know existed,
and put us on our guard, for which I many times feel truly thankful.
I often am thinking of Jonathan Taylor,--how he was removed
from the conflict he would have had to go through,
if he had been preserved in integrity as to Friends`' ancient principles.
We have no recent account of Chas.
Osborn.
I think he was much harassed while here, with opposing sentiments.

Elizabeth Robson has now a minute from our Monthly Meeting to visit Friends in Manchester,
in which arduous service she is now engaged.
I wish her labors may be blessed to profit those whom she is among,
for there is great need of faithful, upright Friends to witness for Truth among them.
The meeting is in an affecting state as to the soundness of its heads,
who too much think themselves whole, and sound and wise; and, I fear,
have little knowledge of the real work of Truth in the inner man,
or they would scorn the mean, specious ways of bringing others over to their views,
which has fallen more than once under our observation to be done by some; and,
in practice, the old Jesuitical doctrine brought out, of the end sanctifying the means,
and all to be covered up with the mantle of faith.

I believe some will be landed, at last,
in conduct and opinions they little thought they could ever arrive at,
when first warped from the integrity of Truth.
Riches, and the love of the world, are some of the roots of these evils;
then comes craving for more liberty, and religion must be fitted to allow of it,
that we may have a name among men.
On these things, I have often many sorrowful meditations,
but am comforted with a secret feeling, that Providence will interpose,
and has already for the deliverance of the faithful among us,
from the mixture that the workings of corrupt,
unsubdued wills have introduced into our Society.

It will now, I think, be seen, who are sound, and who are not;
which is a great point gained,
to have the mists cleared up which have enveloped some amongst us;
and I desire nothing more than that such may go forth from us who are not of us,
which is far better; and I for one am quite willing to go through it,
rather than leave the burden of such a mixture on the next generation.
I fear this will be a long time in reaching thee,
but I hope thou wilt excuse it and all its errors,
being a proof of my near love and unity with thee and thy labors in this land.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend John Wilbur,

Permit me to express my warmest wishes for thy preservation on every hand,
and safe return to thy native shores, seeing we must part with thee,
and mayst thou feel a peaceful relief from those heavy exercises
through which it has been thy lot to wade,
in the course of thy valuable labors in this land.
As thy religious services here are drawing so near a conclusion,
thoughts of home will naturally be indulged,
which brings me to the recital of that little anecdote thou wished me to pen,
although imperfectly related, from wanting the names;--it was thus: "`Some years ago,
a valuable, ministering Friend, residing in a very obscure, humble cottage,
I think in Westmoreland, had a concern to attend the Yearly Meeting.
During his stay in and about town,
he was so much introduced to the tables of the affluent,
as well as to their general habits, that some,
wondering how he would bear so great a reverse as returning to his own poor home,
asked his companion to take notice,--his report was most satisfactory.
On espying it at a distance, his countenance beamed with delight, while he exclaimed,
'`Aye, thou bonny Grey rig!
I hanna seen sic`' a turtle`'s nest sin`' I left thee.`'`"

Possessing the true riches,
this simple-hearted Christian had been taught how
to rightly estimate earthly grandeur and possessions,
his treasure being where "`moth and rust do not corrupt;`"
quitting the bustling scenes of town would,
no doubt, be making a joyful retreat, as from the midday sun into the shade,
so much more favorable to contemplation,
and waiting for the descendings of heavenly good;
sitting as under his own "`vine and fig-tree;`"--feelings like these are what
I fondly anticipate for my dear friend on reaching his long-deserted home,
even although the vacant seat of one can hardly fail
to cast a momentary gloom over the scene;
but may it quickly be dispelled by renewed ability to bless the Hand that gave,
and whose sovereign right it is to take away.

But this state of resignation being unattainable by our own strength,
I believe the most favored minds have long to wait for it,
so powerful are the ties that bind us to these dear objects of our affection and solicitude.
We shall probably often talk, and much oftener think of thee,
when tossing on the billowy deep,
with fervent desires that thy return from this arduous
field of labor may be richly crowned with peace,
even the hundred fold.

Ackworth School, 8th of 2nd mo., 1833.

[.salutation]
My Dear Friend John Wilbur,

We rejoiced to learn that thy labors of love in our country, which, I believe,
have been generally acceptable, are drawing to a satisfactory conclusion.
As regards thyself,
I have no doubt the answer will be peace,--the reward of faithful service.
And though thou wilt mourn over us when thou art
again permitted to reach thy native shores,
and to enjoy the society of thy kindred and friends,
if thy doing so be in the ordering of thy great Master`'s
councils,--I say thou wilt mourn over us,
as a Society, because we are a degenerate, still-declining, motley people; yet,
I believe,
thou wilt have satisfaction in having faithfully warned us of our dangerous state,
and tried to stir us up to more diligence,
in pursuing the things which belong to our everlasting peace.

We certainly have had line upon line and precept upon precept,
many solemn messages from the Lord`'s servants,
and divers manifestations of his displeasure with our ways,
in the judgments with which our nation, as well as many others, has lately been visited.
I frequently remember the words of our friend Daniel Wheeler,
uttered at York during the time of our Quarterly Meeting, in the 9th month of last year,
when the cholera, which had so generally prevailed in this island,
was apparently rather subsiding, viz:
that what this country had then suffered was only like the shaking of the rod.

At the present time, the pestilence appears to be stayed.
If the saying of the prophet might happily be verified among us,
"`When the judgments of the Almighty are in the earth,
the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness,`" probably our highly-favored
country might still be spared and protected from further calamity.

I do not feel quite satisfied, without saying,
that I have read thy letters to George Crosfield with much satisfaction.
My sincere desire is that they may be much read,
and sufficiently pondered by persons of different ranks and ages in our Society,
many of whom, I am quite sure, stand in need of such a salutary caveat in these times.
We shall very often think of thee,
and shall rejoice to hear of thy safe arrival in Rhode Island.
Repeating the message of dear love from thy different friends here,
my wife and daughter especially joining,

[.signed-section-closing]
I am truly thy affectionate friend,
